DESCRIPTION

  This directory contains Prolog files that implement the Juno compilation
  equations. To use them, first run the Stony Brook Prolog interpretter
  "sbprolog" (which lives in /proj/mips/bin). Then, load each of the Prolog
  files. You can load them all at once by typing the following at the "| ?-"
  prompt:

    ['built-in.pl', 'gamma.pl', 'misc.pl', 'scope.pl', 'sets.pl'].

  (It is necessary to type the final period.) Then, to compile a Juno command,
  type "c(<command>)." at the prompt. See the file "gamma.pl" for a
  description of the syntax of Juno commands as they are understood by these
  equations.

CONTENTS

    built-in.pl		database of built-in Juno predicates/functions
    gamma.pl		main file containing transformation equations
    misc.pl		miscellaneous predicates used by "gamma.pl"
    scope.pl		predicate/function definitions
    sets.pl		miscellaneous predicates for manipulating sets
    tests.txt		test compilation lines
