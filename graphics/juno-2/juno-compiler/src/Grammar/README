DESCRIPTION

  These are the Juno grammar files read and written by LLGen(1), Bill Kalsow's
  LL(1) parser-generator. The primary purpose of these files is to check that
  the Juno grammar is in fact LL(1).

  To test the grammar for legality, log in to bigtop, cd to this directory,
  and type "make". Grammar errors are sent to the standard output. If the
  input is legal, but the grammar is not LL(1), errors will appear after LLGen
  has written "producing parser...".

CONTENTS

    Juno.bnf		LL(1) BNF grammar, for use with LLGen(1)
    Juno.out		First and Uses sets produced by LLGen(1) on Juno.bnf
    Makefile		Builds Juno.out from Juno.bnf (on Bigtop only)
