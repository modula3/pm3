DESCRIPTION

  This directory contains the source for a simple program to test Juno's
  run-time interpreter. See the file "RTTest.m3" for details on the format
  of the input understood by the program.

  This directory also contains many byte-code programs on which to test the
  interpreter. The test program reads a byte-code program from standard
  input, so to run one of these tests, use "RTTest < bc.XX".

CONTENTS

  RTTest.m3	source to build test program
  bc-01		output "Hello, World"
  bc-02		add 2 numbers given as input
  bc-03		loop until the stack overflows
  bc-04		solve for the square root of 2
  bc-05		solve for the square root of 2 * PI
  bc-06		compute and print the SIN(PI/3) (no solve)
  bc-07		test the value unparser	
  bc-08		solve for "a" in "(1, a) = [1, 2]" (a = [2])
  bc-09		solve for "x" in "(x, x) = (1, 1)" (x = 1)
  bc-10		solve for "x" in "(x, x) = (1, 2)" (no solution)
  bc-11		solve for "x" in "[[x]] = [["foo"]]" (x = "foo", y = ["foo"])
  bc-12		solve for "x" in "x = (x, x)" (no solution)
  bc-13		solve for "x,y,z" in "y=x+z AND (1,2)=(x,y)" (x=1,y=2,z=1)
  bc-14		solve for "x,y,z" in "x = (y, z)" (x = [NIL], y = NIL, z = NIL)
  bc-15		same as 14, but also require IS-TEXT(y) AND IS-REAL(z)
  bc-16		loop: read a line and print it
  bc-17		loop: compute Factorial(x)
  bc-18		solve for "x" in "IS-TEXT(x) AND x = 1.0" (no solution)
  equal		test equality test on run-time values
  is-int	test the built-in INT() predicate
