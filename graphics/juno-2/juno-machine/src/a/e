Andrew: here are what my goals would have been if I had been more dutiful

at the beginning of the year, together with my analysis of the extent to

which I achieved them:



1. Finish the data abstraction paper with Rustan.



        [~95% achieved]



2. Finish the theorem-prover paper with Jim.



        [~75% achieved]



3. Do something interesting with ESC/Java.



        [Silvija's summer project was interesting, so I would say this goal

was

         accomplished.]



4. Publish the ESC overview paper.



        [Submitted. The mills of the publishing industry

         grind exceedingly slow.]



5. Publish the Juno-2 paper.



        [It will be submitted to SIGGRAPH next week.]



5. Get some interesting experience using ESC/Java.
