# This file is designed to test how the non-linear numeric solver performs
# when the input system contains a subsystem that is linear is a subset of the
# unknowns, but non-linear for the rest of the constraints. The question is
# whether the solver will converge on the exact solution for the linearly
# constrained variables immediately or not.

# Here is the linear subsystem:
#    y = x + 2
#    y = -1 * x
# This system has the solution x = -1, y = 1.

x ~ 0
y
y = PLUS(x, 2)
y = TIMES(-1, x)

# Now we add an additional constraint:
#    d^2 = (x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2
# We must introduce locals to express this constraint in normal form.
