\section{\anchor{Intro}{Introduction}}

Juno is a double-view constraint-based drawing editor. It displays a
program and a drawing; the drawing is produced by running the
program.  You can modify either the drawing or the program, and Juno
will modify the other to keep them in synch.

Juno is both a program and a programming language. The language has
provisions for solving constraints. Juno makes it easy to specify
constraints on your drawing.

When you run Juno, the main top-level Juno window appears. To exit the
program, select the \it{Quit} command under the \it{Juno-2} menu. The
main Juno window has three important sub-windows:

\begin{itemize}
\item the \it{drawing} view on the left,
\item the \it{current module} editor in the upper-right, and
\item the \it{current command} editor in the lower-right.
\end{itemize}

The source code in the current module editor and the current command
editor -- together with the code defined in the built-in modules --
comprise your program. Juno renders your drawing by running the current
command. The current command may refer to predicates, functions, and
procedures defined in the current module, or in one of the built-in
modules.

There are two sliding bars separating the three main sub-windows
that you can drag to change their relative sizes. There is also a
menu bar along the top of the window, and a \it{tool palette} along
the left side. Initially, the tool palette contains the built-in
tools and tools and a sub-palette for the built-in \tt{PS} module.

Juno uses the PostScript drawing model. To paint graphics or text in
the drawing, you call procedures defined in the \tt{PS} module. To
paint graphics, you construct a \it{path} composed of straight and
curved segments, and then you \it{stroke} or \it{fill} the path. To
paint text, you call the procedure \tt{PS.Type}. See the public view
of the \tt{PS} module for details.

\section{\anchor{Options}{Command-line Options}}

By default, Juno displays its main window on the display determined by
the DISPLAY environment variable, opens the file named "Untitled.juno"
in the current directory at start-up, and is configured to print your
drawing in portrait orientation. You can alter this behavior using one
of the following command-line switches:

\begin{description}
\item{\anchor{DisplayOpt}{\bf{-display} \it{Xdisplay}}}
Controls the display on which the main Juno window appears. See the
X(1) man page for a description of the interpretation of the
\it{Xdisplay} argument.

\item{\anchor{GeometryOpt}{\bf{-geometry} \it{Xgeometry}}}
Controls the initial size and location of the main Juno window. See the
X(1) man page for a description of the interpretation of the
\it{Xgeometry} argument.

\item{\anchor{ConfigOpt}{\bf{-config} \it{config-file}}}
Juno maintains certain user-configurable values, such as the fonts
used in the user interface and the number of digits to which
real numbers are pretty-printed in the program view.
Juno first sets each of these values to a built-in
default. You can specify new values for these variables in
a configuration file.

By default, Juno looks for a file named "\tt{.juno-config.sx}", first
in the current directory, then in your home directory (as named by the
\tt{HOME} environment variable). If such a file is found,
configuration settings are read from it, overwriting the defaults. You
can specify a different configuration file using the \bf{-config}
switch. See the section on \link{#ConfigValues}{setting configuration
values} below for descriptions of the configuration values and the
configuration file format.

\item{\anchor{OrientationOpt}{\bf{-portrait}}}
When it renders PostScript for your drawing, Juno will render the
drawing in portrait orientation. This is the default.

\item{\bf{-landscape}}
When it renders PostScript for your drawing, Juno will rotate your
drawing by 90 degrees so as to render it in landscape orientation.
This is convenient for producing slides for a talk.

\item{\anchor{ZeusOpt}{\bf{-zeus}}}
Runs Juno as a server for a single view of the Zeus animation system.
For details, see \link{#Zeus}{Interfacing with Zeus} below.
\end{description}

\section{\anchor{CurrCmd}{The Current Command}}

The current command must be a Juno command. If this command is a
projection, then it will have the following form:

\begin{flushleft}
\tt{VAR} <variables> \tt{IN} [ <constraint> \tt{->} ] <command> \tt{END}
\end{flushleft}

In this case, we will find it convenient to refer to the
<variables>, <constraint>, and <command> sections of
the current command. The <constraint> section in this form is
optional. If the current command is not a projection, then it has no
<variables> or <constraint> sections. Initially, the
current command is \tt{SKIP}, so the drawing is blank.

Changes made through the drawing view change the current command
automatically. For example, when you create a new point in the
drawing, a new variable is added to the <variables> section of
the current command. The new variable's initial value is the
location of its corresponding point.

\section{\anchor{DrawingEdit}{Editing Through the Drawing View}}

To edit through the drawing, you select a tool, and then apply the
tool by clicking, dragging, or typing in the drawing. How you use a
tool depends on the particular tool.

To select a tool, you click on a tool name in any visible tool
palette.  The name of the selected tool is highlighted. Only one
tool can be selected at a time; if some tool was already selected
when you select a new tool, the old tool is automatically
unselected.

There are four kinds of tools:

\begin{itemize}
\item A \it{point} tool is a tool associated with a Juno predicate,
function, or procedure, all of whose arguments are points.

\item A \it{text} tool is a tool associated with a Juno procedure
all of whose arguments are points, except its last argument, which
is a text string.

\item A \it{template} tool is a tool associated with a Juno procedure
that has no arguments.

\item A \it{set} tool is a tool associated with a Juno procedure
with a single argument. These tools get their name from the fact
that they are usually used to set some aspect of the current state,
such as the current fill color or line width. Set tools cannot be
selected. Instead, when you press on a set tool, a menu of possible
arguments appears.

\item The built-in tools \link{#CreateTool}{\it{Create}},
\link{#FreezeTool}{\it{Freeze}}, \link{#DragTool}{\it{Drag}},
\link{#AdjustTool}{\it{Adjust}}, \link{#GridTool}{\it{Grid On} /
\it{Grid Off}}, \link{#RelTool}{\it{Rel}}, \link{#Rel1Tool}{\it{Rel1}},
\link{#GeomTools}{\it{Hor}}, \link{#GeomTools}{\it{Ver}},
\link{#GeomTools}{\it{Cong}}, and \link{#GeomTools}{\it{Para}} are
\it{special}. Each of these tools has its own user interface, and
each has its own particular effect on the current command. See the
section \link{#SpecialTools}{\it{Using the Special Tools}} below
for details.
\end{itemize}

Juno creates point, text, template, and set tools according to \tt{UI}
(user-interface) declarations. See the \link{#UIDecls}
{\it{User-Interface Declarations}} section below for more
information.

\section{\anchor{PointTools}{Using Point Tools}}

To use a point tool, you simply click in the drawing view. Each time
you click, the point \it{closest} to your cursor is selected as the
next point parameter. When you have selected as many points as the
total number of parameters corresponding to the predicate, function,
or procedure associated with the selected point tool, the tool is
\it{applied}.

You can also use the <SPACE> bar to select points. If you have
selected \it{i} points with the current tool, <SPACE> selects the
\it{i}th point argument (counting from 0) to the most recently
applied tool. This shortcut is useful for applying the same tool
several times in a row. For example, to express the hints for the
points \tt{c}, \tt{d}, and \tt{e} all \tt{REL} the points \tt{a} and
\tt{b}, you would:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Click \tt{c}, click \tt{a}, click \tt{b}
\item Click \tt{d}, type <SPACE>, type <SPACE>
\item Click \tt{e}, type <SPACE>, type <SPACE>
\end{enumerate}

How the current command is updated when a point tool is applied
depends on the tool. If the point tool is associated with a
predicate or function, then a call to that predicate or function
using the point arguments you specified is conjoined onto the end of
the <constraint> section of the current command. If the point
tool is associated with a procedure, then a call to that procedure
using the point arguments you specified is appended to the
<command> section of the current command, separated from the
previous <command> by a semicolon.

Using the <SHIFT> key, you can combine the actions of creating and
selecting a point. If you hold down the <SHIFT> key while clicking
with a point tool, then instead of selecting the existing point
nearest your cursor, Juno \it{creates} a new point at the cursor
location and selects it.

By default, newly created points are unfrozen. If you hold down the
<OPTION> (or <ALT>) key while creating a new point (either by using
the \it{Create} tool or by holding down <SHIFT> as described above),
the new point will be initially frozen.

When you use a point tool, you should select points in the order in
which they appear in the signature of the corresponding predicate,
function, or procedure. For example, suppose you are using the tool
associated with the Juno function \tt{Geometry.Mid}, which has the
following signature:

\begin{verbatim}
   FUNC mid = Mid(p, q)
\end{verbatim}

If you then use the \it{Mid} tool to select the points \tt{a},
\tt{b}, and \tt{c} (in that order), Juno will add the constraint
\tt{a = Geometry.Mid(b, c)} to the current command.

\section{\anchor{TextTools}{Using Text Tools}}

Text tools are very similar to point tools. You select points for all
of the arguments except the last one in exactly the same way. When you
get to the last argument, Juno displays a vertical bar in the drawing
view. You can then type the final text argument. As you type, Juno
displays the text string exactly as it is rendered by the procedure.
Once you are done, hit the <RETURN> key or select another tool to
complete the text. The text is also completed if you do something to
cause another window to grab the keyboard focus. Once the text is
completed, Juno will apply the text tool to the arguments you have
supplied.

The Juno-2 user-interface translates certain text argument keys. In
particular, it translates the <TAB> key to tab character (ASCII code
9), the <ESCAPE> key to the escape character (ASCII code 27), and any
control key by subtracting 128 from the control key's ASCII code. For
example, this means that you can include a newline character in the
text string by typing CTRL-<RETURN> (or equivalently, CTRL-J).
Similarly, you can include a form feed character by typing CTRL-L, or
a tab character by typing <TAB> or CTRL-I. The procedure implementing
the text tool can be written to act on these characters in its
argument. For example, the procedures in the bundled \tt{TypeLinesC},
\tt{TypeLinesL}, and \tt{TypeLinesR} modules interpret the newline
character by starting a new line of a text block.

\section{\anchor{TemplateTools}{Using Template Tools}}

Clicking on a template tool replaces the current command with the 
body of the procedure associated with the tool.   Thus many drawings 
can be produced starting from the same template.  For example, a template
for drawing a group of slides might draw the border and create control
points for positioning the title and other elements common to many slides. 

When you click on a template tool, the previous contents of the current 
command are lost.  

\section{\anchor{SetTools}{Using Set Tools}}

Set tools are used to set some aspect of the current state. They are
associated with procedures taking a single argument of arbitrary
type. When you press on the name of a set tool in the tool palette,
a menu of possible arguments appears. When you drag the mouse and
select one of these menu items, a call to the procedure with that
argument is appended to the <command> section of the current
command.

\section{\anchor{UIDecls}{User-Interface Declarations}}

You tell Juno which predicates, functions, and procedures in the
current module to create tools for using \tt{UI} declarations. There
are four legal forms for this declaration:

\begin{description}
\item{\tt{UI PointTool(}<Id>\tt{)}}

This declares the predicate, function, or procedure named <Id> in the 
current module to be a point tool. If <Id> names a procedure, it must 
have zero \it{out} and \it{inout} parameters.

\item{\tt{UI TextTool(}<Id>\tt{)}}

This declares the procedure named <Id> in the current module to be a text 
tool. <Id> must name a procedure with at least one \it{in} parameter and 
zero \it{out} and \it{inout} parameters. The last parameter
must be a text; the other parameters (if any) must be points. When the
tool is used, the procedure will be called for each prefix of the
string the user types (with a vertical bar character appended at the
right). There will be a final call to the procedure with the whole
string and no vertical bar. In the first calls, the PostScript state
will be automatically saved and restored, so only the side-effects to
the PostScript state made by the final call will take effect.

\item{\tt{UI Template(}<Id>\tt{)}}

This declares the procedure named <Id> in the current module to be a template 
tool. <Id> must name a procedure with no parameters.

\item{\tt{UI SetTool(}<Id>\tt{)}}

This declares the procedure named <Id> in the current module to be a set
tool. <Id> must name a procedure with exactly one \it{in} parameter and 
zero \it{out} and \it{inout} parameters.

\item{\tt{UI Param(}<Id>\tt{,} <Value>\tt{)}}

This declares <Value> to be a parameter of the set tool <Id>. If <Id> is 
the argument to some \tt{SetTool} user-interface declaration in the 
current module, then <Value> will be one of the values appearing in its 
menu. <Value> must be either a literal Juno value or a (possibly
qualified) identifier that names a \tt{CONST}, \tt{VAR}, or \tt{PROC}.

Notice that since \tt{<Id>} must be an unqualified identifier, the
\tt{Param} declaration cannot be used to add a parameter to a set
tool in some other module. However, that is not much of a
restriction, since you can easily create a set tool in the current
module that simply invokes the set tool in the other module, and add
any number of parameters to the local set tool.
\end{description}

\section{\anchor{SpecialTools}{Using the Special Tools}}

Here is a list of the special tools and descriptions of how to use them.

\begin{description}
\item{\anchor{CreateTool}{\it{Create}}}

Each time you click with the \it{Create} tool, a new point is
created at the cursor location. The name of the point and its
initial location are added to the <variables> section of the
current command. If you don't like the name Juno chooses for a
point, you can edit the name of the corresponding variable in the
current command.

\item{\anchor{FreezeTool}{\it{Freeze}}}

Selecting a point with the \it{Freeze} tool toggles its state
between unfrozen and frozen. By default, newly created points are
unfrozen. The Juno constraint solver is allowed to change the
locations of unfrozen points, but not the locations of frozen
points. However, you can still move a frozen point yourself using
the \link{#DragTool}{\it{Drag}} and \link{#AdjustTool}{\it{Adjust}}
tools described below.

In the drawing view, the names of unfrozen points are painted in
black, while those of frozen points are painted in an ice-blue
color. In the current command, the initial values of unfrozen points
are only hinted with the near (\tt{~}) predicate, while those of
frozen points are fixed with the equality (\tt{=}) predicate.

Since freezing is such a common operation, there is a shortcut for it
that doesn't require you to select the \it{Freeze} tool explicitly:
simply right-click to toggle a point's frozen state.  Right mouse
clicks are ignored if you are in the middle of supplying arguments to
some tool.

\item{\anchor{DragTool}{\it{Drag}}}

You can drag a point with the \it{Drag} tool. While you drag the
point, Juno solves your constraints and updates the drawing at each
new cursor location. When you are done dragging, the new location
for each point is displayed in the current command.

Of course, since there may be constraints on the point you are
dragging, the point will not necessarily track the mouse. For
example, if you are dragging a point \tt{a} that is constrained to
be horizontal with a frozen point \tt{b}, then \tt{a} will only move
horizontally, even if there is some vertical component to the mouse
motion. In such cases, it is convenient for the cursor to specify only
the horizontal or vertical location of the dragged point. If you hold
down the \it{shift} key when you start your drag, the dragged point is
constrained to being horizontal with the cursor; if you hold down the
\it{control} or \it{alt} key, it is constrained to being vertical with
the cursor.

Since dragging is such a common operation, there is a shortcut for it
that doesn't require you to select the \it{Drag} tool explicitly:
simply middle-press to drag a point. The modifier keys may still be
used to constrain the drag as above. Middle mouse clicks are ignored
if you are in the middle of supplying arguments to some tool.

\item{\anchor{AdjustTool}{\it{Adjust}}}

You can also drag a point with the \it{Adjust} tool, but Juno does
not continuously solve your constraints and update your drawing as
you drag the point. Instead, it simply solves the constraints and
updates your drawing for the final location of the point. If you hold
down the \it{shift} key at the start of the drag, the adjusted point
will only move horizontally; if you hold down the \it{control} or
\it{alt} key, it will only move vertically.

The \it{Adjust} tool differs from the \it{Drag} tool in another
important respect. While using the \it{Drag} tool, you cannot drag a
point to a location that fails to solve your constraints. This is
not the case with the \it{Adjust} tool. For example, if you adjust a
frozen point \tt{a} that is constrained to be horizontal with
another frozen point \tt{b}, your current command will produce a
run-time error with overwhelming probability (unless you just
happened to adjust \tt{a} to a location that was exactly on the
horizontal line through \tt{b}).

\item{\anchor{GridTool}{\it{Grid On / Grid Off}}}

The \it{Grid On} tool turns on a grid determined by two
selected points called the \it{control points} of the
grid. Selecting the points \tt{a} and \tt{b} as the grid control
points activates the grid of points \tt{(x,y) REL (a,b)} for all
\it{integers} \tt{x} and \tt{y}. When you apply the \it{Grid On}
tool, the name of the tool changes to \it{Grid Off} in the
tool palette. If you click on \it{Grid Off}, the grid is
deactivated, and the tool name changes back to \it{Grid On}.

When the grid is active, Juno paints tiny black dots at the grid
lattice points. Whenever a new point \tt{c} is created, it is
automatically positioned at the lattice point closest to the mouse
click. The hint for \tt{c} is represented \tt{REL} the grid control
points \tt{a} and \tt{b}, and \tt{c} is initially frozen. Note that
this does not imply that \tt{c} cannot move; only that \tt{c}'s
location is functionally determined by \tt{a} and \tt{b}.

When the grid is active, Juno tries to snap adjusted (but not
dragged) points to the nearest lattice point. This rule applies to
the grid control points \tt{a} and \tt{b} as well! To move a point
to a non-lattice point, you must drag it instead of adjusting it. If
you want to adjust either \tt{a} or \tt{b} to a non-lattice point,
you can also turn the grid off, adjust the point, and then turn the
grid back on.

\item{\anchor{RelTool}{\it{Rel}}}

The \it{Rel} tool converts a hint for a point (such as \tt{c ~
(100,150)}) into a hint relative to two other points. Selecting the
points \tt{c}, \tt{a}, and \tt{b} (in that order) converts the hint
for \tt{c} to the form \tt{c ~ (x,y) REL (a,b)}. The values for \tt{x}
and \tt{y} are computed so that the new hint for \tt{c} has the same
value as the original one. Due to the semantics of the Juno \tt{REL}
function, the current command will produce a run-time error if the
last two points you select with the \it{Rel} tool are not distinct.

If \tt{c} already has a hint of the form \tt{(x,y) REL (a,b)} and you
select the points \tt{c}, \tt{a}, and \tt{b}, the hint for \tt{c} is
converted back to an equivalent absolute hint of the form
\tt{(x',y')}.

\item{\anchor{Rel1Tool}{\it{Rel1}}}

The \it{Rel1} tool converts a hint for a point into a hint relative to
another point. Selecting the points \tt{b} and \tt{a} (in that order)
converts the hint for \tt{b} to the form \tt{b ~ R2.Plus(a,(x,y))}.
The values for \tt{x} and \tt{y} are computed so that the new hint for
\tt{b} has the same value as the original one.

If \tt{b} already has a hint of the form \tt{b ~ R2.Plus(a,(x,y))}
and you select the points \tt{b} and \tt{a}, the hint for \tt{b} is
converted back to an equivalent absolute hint of the form
\tt{(x',y')}.

\item{\anchor{GeomTools}{\it{Hor}, \it{Ver}, \it{Cong}, \it{Para}}}

You use the \it{Hor}, \it{Ver}, \it{Cong}, and \it{Para} tools just
like point tools, but they update the current command to use the
syntax of the built-in Juno predicates \tt{HOR}, \tt{VER},
\tt{CONG}, and \tt{PARA}.

The \it{Hor} and \it{Ver} tools both take two (point) arguments. If
you select the points \tt{a} and \tt{b} with the \it{Hor} or
\it{Ver} tool, then the constraint \tt{a HOR b} or \tt{a VER b},
respectively, is conjoined to the end of the <constraint>
section of the current command.

The \it{Cong} and \it{Para} tools both take four (point)
arguments. If you select the points \tt{a}, \tt{b}, \tt{c}, and
\tt{d} with the \it{Cong} or \it{Para} tool, then the constraint
\tt{(a,b) CONG (c,d)} or \tt{(a,b) PARA (c,d)}, respectively, is
conjoined to the end of the <constraint> section of the current
command.
\end{description}

\section{\anchor{DrawingView}{The Drawing View}}

The origin of the Juno coordinate system is the center of
the drawing view; x-coordinates increase to the east, and
y-coordinates increase to the north. The units of the Juno
coordinate system are PostScript points, equivalent to 1/72 of an
inch.

Normally, Juno maintains the invariant that running the current
command produces the picture in the drawing view. In fact, whenever
Juno needs to repaint the drawing (for example, because you have
enlarged the drawing view window), it simply executes the current
command.

However, the drawing view also displays four extra
\anchor{Annotations}{annotations}. These annotations appear on your
screen, but not on printed output:

\begin{itemize}
\item The drawing view displays the current PostScript path as a
thin red line. This allows you to see the path as you construct it,
before it is stroked or filled.

\item Juno displays annotations for the point variables in the
current command. The annotation displayed for each point depends on
what you have selected in the \it{Labels} menu. If you have selected
\it{Letters}, then Juno displays a small dot at the point location,
along with the name of the variable to the left of and below the
dot. If you have selected \it{Crosses}, then a small cross is drawn
at the point location. Usually, these annotations are black, but
they are blue if the point is frozen. If you have selected
\it{Nothing}, then no point annotations are shown.

\item If the grid has been activated by the built-in
\link{#GridTool}{\it{Grid On}} tool, Juno annotates the drawing
view by painting small black dots at the grid's lattice points.

\item Juno displays the current \it{bounding box} as a rectangle
with a grey border. The bounding box is part of the PostScript
state, and is set by the \tt{PS.SetBBox} procedure. See the \tt{PS}
module for details.
\end{itemize}

Juno performs certain actions before and after running the current
command.  Before running the command, it blanks the screen and
resets the PostScript state. After running the current command, it
calls \tt{PS.ShowPage} to display your drawing, and then it paints
the annotations described above.  Notice that global variables in
the current module and built-in modules are not reset to their
initial values each time the current command is run; they maintain
their values from run to run.

\section{\anchor{UsingRun}{Using the ``Run'' Button}}

As stated earlier, Juno usually maintains the invariant that running the
current command produces the picture in the drawing view.  However, there
are two cases where the drawing view may not be up-to-date with the
current command.

The first case occurs when you edit either the current command or the
current module directly. If you click in either the current command
editor or the module editor and edit your program, the invariant is
broken.

The second case occurs when you apply a constraint through the drawing
view.  Since constraints are typically applied in batches, Juno does not
attempt to update the drawing each time you enter a constraint. Instead,
the constraint is added to the current command, but the current command
is not re-executed.  Hence, the drawing become out-of-date with respect
to the current command.

Whenever the drawing becomes out-of-date, clicking on the
\anchor{RunButton}{\it{Run}} button re-establishes the invariant by
compiling the current command and the current module, and then
running the current command. Even if the drawing view is up-to-date,
\it{Run} can be used to re-run the current command; this is useful
if the current command is an animation.

\section{\anchor{LongRunning}{Working with Long-running Commands}}

If you are writing a long-running current command such as an
animation, you may want to compile your program and solve its
constraints without actually seeing it run. In that case, you can use
the \it{Solve} button instead of the \it{Run} button.

The \anchor{SolveButton}{\it{Solve}} button is like the
\link{#RunButton}{\it{Run}} button, except that it compiles and runs
a version of the current command that only solves the current
command's constraints and treats its \tt{<commands>} section as
\tt{SKIP}. Hence, except for the \link{#Annotations} {annotations
described earlier}, your drawing will appear blank when you use
\it{Solve}. To run the complete current command, use \it{Run}
instead. The \it{Solve} button is only active when the drawing view
is out-of-date with respect to the current module or current
command.

Whenever Juno needs to repaint the drawing view --- for example, when
the drawing view is reshaped or when you drag or adjust a point ---
it runs the current command implicitly. If you are working on a
long-running command, this can be quite tedious.

The \it{Refresh} menu lets you configure how the current command
should be run. By default, it is set to \it{Auto Run}, which means
the current command is run completely as per the \it{Run}
button. However, if you set the refresh mode to \it{Auto Solve}, the
body of the current command is ignored as per the \it{Solve} button
when the drawing is refreshed implicitly. You will probably want to
set the refresh mode to \it{Auto Solve} if you are writing a
long-running command such as an animation.

\section{\anchor{Folding}{Folding}}

Juno drawings are typically constructed in a ``bottom-up''
fashion. You can write procedures for drawing the smaller components
of your drawing, then procedures that call those procedures to draw
larger components, etc. At each step, you draw a component as a
completely separate drawing, and then you convert the current command
for drawing that component into a procedure. You can also click in a
complex constraint, and then convert it into a predicate. The general
operation of converting the current command into a procedure or
predicate for later re-use is called \it{folding}.

When you select \it{Fold...} from the \it{Edit} menu, Juno displays
a dialog box with a type-in field and two sets of radio buttons. You
can specify the name of the new procedure or predicate by editing
the type-in field. The first set of radio buttons let you choose
whether to fold the current command as a procedure, predicate, or template. 

Although the dialog box does not provide a way to fold the current 
command into a function, you can easily convert a folded predicate 
into a function by editing its signature. If you fold as a procedure 
or predicate, the second set of radio buttons lets you specify whether 
you want a point tool associated with the folded command or not.  
If you fold the current command as a template, you always get a template 
tool. 

Once you click the \it{Ok} button in the dialog box, Juno converts 
the current command into a procedure or predicate, appends the procedure 
or predicate definition to the current module, together with a \tt{UI} 
declaration if appropriate, and replaces the current command by \tt{SKIP}. 

There are two ways in which you can control the parameters of the
procedure or predicate.

The first (and best) way is to type in the dialog box the names of the
points that you want to become arguments, enclosing the list in
parentheses and placing it after the name of the procedure or
predicate. For example, if you have drawn an equilateral triangle with
vertices \tt{a}, \tt{b}, and \tt{c}, you could fold the drawing as a
procedure and type \tt{"EqTr(a,b)"} in dialog box to specify that the
folded procedure is to have the name \tt{"EqTr"} and the parameters
\tt{a} and \tt{b}.

When you fold the current command into a procedure or predicate and
specify which points become parameters, Juno automatically makes the
other points local variables, and automatically gives them appropriate
hints. If there are at least two parameters, the hints for the local
variables are \tt{REL} to the first two parameters. If there is only
one parameter, the hints are constant offsets from that one parameter.
If there are no parameters, the hints are absolute.

The second way to control the parameters of the procedure or predicate
is to omit the parenthesized list of arguments in the dialog box. This
is usually less convenient than the way described above, but is
supported for backwards compatibility. In this case Juno determines
the parameters to the new procedure or predicate by the following
rule: Those <variables> of the current command that are unhinted or
whose hints are pairs of numbers (i.e., literal point values) become
parameters. All other <variables> of the current command become local
variables of the folded procedure or predicate. These variables
typically have hints expressed \tt{REL} two other points. Notice that
whether a point becomes a parameter to the procedure/predicate or a
local variable of it depends only on the form of the point's hint, not
on whether it is frozen.

\section{\anchor{FoldingAnims}{Folding Animations}}

Juno has a built-in \tt{Anim} module for producing animations. The
general technique for creating an animation is to divide it into
scenes, produce animations for each of the scenes, and then combine
those animations using operators like \tt{Anim.Seq} and \tt{Anim.Co}.

To produce each scene, there are two steps:

First, you draw a (still) figure constrained by a slider. Juno
has a built-in \tt{Slider} module for drawing sliders and constraining
points against the slider's value. You figure should include a call to
\tt{Slider.Draw(a,b,c)}, where the points \tt{a} and \tt{c} determine
the endpoints of the slider, and the horizontal position of the point
\tt{b} determines the location of the slider's thumb.

Second, you fold the figure as an animation using the \tt{Fold
As Animation...} command in the \tt{Edit} menu. This brings up a
dialogue box in which you specify the name and arguments of the folded
scene (as when \link{#Folding}{folding} a figure into a procedure or
predicate) and the names of the three slider points. If your current
command includes a call to \tt{Slider.Draw}, then the slider points
will be filled in automatically from it.

Folding an animation produces three procedures in the current module,
and changes the current command into a command which, when
\link{#UsingRun}{run}, animates the figure as if you had dragged the
slider smoothly from 0 to 1 over the course of 1 second.

Suppose you typed \tt{MoveDot(p,q)} in the \tt{Fold As Animation...}
dialogue box, and specified slider points \tt{a,b,c}. Then the three
procedures produced would have the following signatures:

\begin{verbatim}
  PROC MoveDot(p,q,a,b,c);
  PROC MoveDotFrame(p,q,t);
  PROC an := MoveDotAnim(p,q);
\end{verbatim}

The first of these procedures is like the one produced by
\link{#Folding}{folding} into a procedure or predicate with points
\tt{p} and \tt{q}, but in addition, the points \tt{a}, \tt{b}, and
\tt{c} specify the control points for the slider. The second procedure
draws the animation at time \tt{t}, for \tt{t} in the interval
\tt{[0,1]}. The third procedure produces an animation object that
plays the animation for a duration of 1 second.

\section{\anchor{PushPop}{Pushing and Popping the Current Command}}

Juno also provides a mechanism for \it{pushing} the current command
so that you can save your current work in order to create and fold a
component you hadn't anticipated needing.  Once you are done folding
this new component, you can \it{pop} the current command and resume
work where you left off. You can push any number of commands onto
the command stack.

When you select \anchor{PushCmd}{\it{Push Current Command}} from the
\it{Edit} menu, Juno wraps a procedure declaration around the
current command and installs this procedure in the current
module. The new procedure has a name of the form \tt{CmdX} (where
\it{X} is a small integer) and takes no arguments. A procedure in
the current module of this form is said to be on the \it{current
command stack}, and to have index \it{X}. The value chosen for
\it{X} is one more than the largest index on the current command
stack; the command with the largest index is the top of the
stack. You can rearrange procedures on the stack simply by renaming
their indices and clicking the \link{#RunButton}{\it{Run}} or
\link{#SolveButton}{\it{Solve}} button. By default, point tools are
not created for commands on the current command stack.

If the current command is \tt{SKIP} and you select \it{Pop Current
Command} from the \it{Edit} menu, Juno replaces the current command
with the body of the procedure on the top of the current command
stack, and deletes the associated procedure declaration from the
current module.

\section{\anchor{CurrMod}{The Current Module}}

The current module must be a legal Juno module. In addition to
folded predicates, functions, and procedures, you can also define
global constants and variables in the current module.

Whenever you click \it{Run} or \it{Solve} or select one of the
commands for \link{#Folding}{folding, pushing, or popping}, the
current module is re-compiled. Juno creates a tool for each point
tool, text tool, or set tool in the current module. The buttons for
these tools appear in the tool palette below the buttons for the
special tools. You can use these tools just like the tools
associated with the built-in modules.

Any \tt{MODULE} declaration in the current module is ignored. Hence,
calls in the current command to tools derived from the current
module will be unqualified.

\section{\anchor{LoadSave}{Loading/Saving the Current Module}}

The contents of the current module and current command correspond to a
disk file. The name of the file is shown at the far right of the menu
bar. Whenever the disk file is out-of-date with respect to the
contents of the current module or current command, the file name is
displayed with a red background.

When you start Juno, it reads the file named \anchor{FilenameArg}
{\it{filename}} you specified on the command line, or the file named
\tt{Untitled.juno} (in the current working directory) by default.
This file is then loaded into the current module.

If you want to load a different file into the current module, choose
the \it{Open...} command from the \it{File} menu.  This command
brings up a standard dialog box for specifying the name and location
of a file. If you type the name of a new file, Juno creates it for
you.

To save the current module, use the \it{Save} command under the
\it{File} menu. This operation will fail if you don't have write
permission on the corresponding file. Also, \it{Save} will result in
an error if either the current module or current command contains a
parse or compilation error.

To save the current module to a file with a new name, choose the
\it{Save As...} command under the \it{File} menu. This command brings
up a standard dialog box that allows you to specify the new name
and/or location for the file.

To reload the current module from the disk file, overwriting the
current editor contents, choose the \it{Reload} command under the
\it{File} menu.

To clear the current editor contents, choose the \it{Clear All}
command under the \it{File} menu. Using \it{Clear All} immediately
followed by \it{Save} will erase the corresponding disk file.

\section{\anchor{BuiltIn}{The Built-in Modules}}

Juno comes bundled with a small collection of built-in modules. One of
these --- the \tt{PS} module --- is automatically opened when
you run Juno.

To open one of the other built-in modules, select the \it{Open
Module...}  command from the \it{File} menu. This command brings up a
dialog box with a list of the available built-in modules. To select a
module, double-click on its name. You can open several built-in
modules in a row. Click the \it{close box} in the upper-left corner
of the dialog box to close it.

The currently open modules are displayed in the tool palette. They
are packed into columns as space permits; new columns are started as
necessary to display them all.

The name of each module is actually an anchor of a pop-up menu. By
default, buttons appear below the module name for each tool declared
in the module. The \it{Collapse} and \it{Expand} commands in the
pop-up menu alternately toggle between displaying these
buttons. (Collapsing the buttons is useful if you want to make room
for other modules in the tool palette.) The \it{Close} command in
the pop-up menu closes the module and removes it from the tool
palette altogether.

If you choose the \it{Help...} command in the pop-up menu, a
separate top-level window appears. The help window displays either a
\it{public} or \it{private} view of the module. You can switch
between the public and private views of the module using the
\it{View} menu at the top of the help window.

Initially, the help window displays a \it{public} view of the
module. The public view is like the interface to the module. It does
not include the private declarations in the interface (including
private comments), nor does it include the bodies of public
predicates, functions, and procedures.

The private view of the module is complete. It includes the private
declarations, private comments, and all predicate, function, and
procedure bodies. Certain modules, like the \tt{PS}, \tt{Text},
\tt{Time}, and \tt{Unit} modules don't have private views, since
their implementations are hard-coded into the Juno application.

\section{\anchor{Printing}{Printing, Previewing, and Producing PostScript}}

Juno produces PostScript output. You can send your drawing directly
to a PostScript printer or previewer, or you can save it to a file
as a PostScript program.

Juno arranges that the PostScript origin is at the center of the page,
so a figure centered in the drawing window will also be centered on
the printed output. To set the bounding box of the PostScript output,
your current command should call the procedure \tt{PS.SetBBox}. By
default, the bounding box is the size of a full 8-1/2 by 11 inch page,
or 11 by 8-1/2 if you ran Juno with the
\link{#Orientation}{\bf{-landscape}} switch.

If you select \it{Print} from the \it{File} menu, your drawing is
printed on the printer named by your \tt{PRINTER} environment
variable.  The header page is labeled ``Juno Output''. If you select
\it{Preview} from the \it{File} menu, your drawing is previewed with
the PostScript previewer psview(1).

You can also save the PostScript for your drawing to a file. If you
select \it{Save PostScript}, the PostScript is written to a file with
the same name as the current module, but with \tt{ps} as its
extension. If you select \it{Save PostScript As...} from the \it{File}
menu, a dialog box pops up that allows you to specify a different name
for the PostScript file.

What you see on the screen is not exactly what you get when you print your
Juno drawing on a printer. Here are the known dissimilarities:

\begin{itemize}
\item The screen fonts and the printer fonts may have slightly
different sizes.  However, the \tt{PS.StringWidth} and
\tt{PS.FontHeight} procedures return different values for screen
fonts than for printer fonts, so if you make calculations based on
their results, your drawing will be rendered correctly on both the
screen and the printer.

\item Due to a feature of the X window system, a sub-path whose
start and end points are coincident will appear closed on the
screen, even if it is an open sub-path. Do not rely on point
coincidence to produce closed sub-paths; instead, use the
\tt{PS.Close} procedure to close sub-paths explicitly.

\item When stroking a path with mitered joints, any joint with a
small enough joint angle is rendered as a beveled joint. This
cut-off angle may differ slightly between the screen and the
printer.

\item The current line width is rounded to the nearest integer to
determine the width of paths stroked on the screen. On the printer,
the line width is not rounded.
\end{itemize}

\section{\anchor{Pixmaps}{Producing Pixmaps in GIF Format}}

To include a Juno drawing in a web page, you have to convert the
drawing to a pixmap in the GIF file format. There are at least three
ways to do this.

If you have psview(1) installed and are using psview for your
previewer, follow these steps. This process also has the advantage
that it respects any bounding box you may have specified for your
figure.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Choose \it{Preview} from the \it{File} menu. This should run the
psview(1) PostScript previewer on your figure. If not, you need to
\link{#ConfigValues}{configure} Juno to run psview(1) for its preview
command.

\item
Scale the Juno drawing to a fixed scale factor such as 2.
With the cursor over the psview window, type "2s". If your drawing is
large, it may not all fit on the screen, in which case you will have
to scale it by a smaller factor. For example, to make it original size
(a scale factor of 1), type "1s".

\item
With the cursor still over the psview window, type "^S". This saves
the figure as a pixmap file named "\tt{Pixmap###.ppm}" in the current
directory, where "\tt{###}" will be a small integer number like
"\tt{001}". The exact name of the pixmap file is displayed in the
window's title bar.

\item
Convert the pixmap file to a GIF file by using pnm(5) tools in the
following pipeline:
\begin{verbatim}
% pnmscale 0.5 Pixmap001.ppm | ppmquant 256 | ppmtogif > fig.gif
\end{verbatim}
Here, the argument "0.5" is the reciprocal of the scale factor
specified to psview in step 2 above. If you used a scale factor of 1,
you don't have to use pnmscale(1). Also, the use of ppmquant(1) in
this pipeline is only necessary if the original pixmap contains over
256 colors; but it doesn't hurt to use ppmquant(1) in any case
\end{enumerate}

To produce a GIF file from a general PostScript file, follow these
steps. This method has the disadvantage that is requires an extra
clipping step, even if you specified a bounding box for your drawing.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Save your figure in PostScript format using the \it{Save PostScript}
command in the \it{File} menu.

\item
Render the figure with ghostscript using the following command line
(assuming the figure's PostScript is in a file named "fig.ps"):
\begin{verbatim}
% gs -sDEVICE=ppmraw -sOutputFile=fig.ppm -r200 -dNOPAUSE -q -- fig.ps
\end{verbatim}
This produces a pixmap file "fig.ppm" with a resolution of 200 dpi
(dots per inch).

\item
Scale the figure down and convert it to GIF format:
\begin{verbatim}
% pnmscale 0.5 fig.ppm | ppmquant 256 | ppmtogif > fig.gif
\end{verbatim}
The scale factor "0.5" will scale the figure down to 100 dpi. If you
want your final figure to have a different resolution, you can use a
smaller resolution in the previous step, or a smaller scale factor in
this step. For example, using "-r180" in the previous step and a scale
factor of "0.5" will produce a GIF file with a resolution of 90 dpi.

\item
You may now need to crop the resulting "fig.gif" file. One way to
do that is to run xv(1) on the GIF file. This will bring up a
page-size window containing your figure. Select a cropping rectangle
by dragging with your mouse. The size and position of the cropping
rectangle can be fine-tuned using the arrow keys on your keyboard: the
unmodified arrow keys move the rectangle a pixel at a time, and the
shifted arrow keys change the size of the rectangle by adjusting its
east and south borders.

Once you've adjusted the cropping rectangle to
your taste, right-click on the xv window. This will bring up the "xv
controls" window. Click on the button labeled \it{Crop}, which will
crop your figure to the cropping rectangle you selected. Then click on
the \it{Save} button to save the cropped version of your figure in GIF
format. Finally, click on the \it{Quit} button in the "xv controls"
window to exit xv(1).
\end{enumerate}

A third alternative is to take a snapshot of your Juno window using
the X window-dump xwd(1) program. This avoids the step of converting
the figure to PostScript. Here is the recipe:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Make sure that point labels have been turned off. Then take a snapshot
of your Juno window by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
% sleep 2; xwd -name Juno > fig.xwd
\end{verbatim}
The "sleep 2" command gives you 2 seconds to arrange for the Juno
window to be exposed. You will hear a single beep indicating the
capture has started, followed by a double-beep indicating it is complete.

\item
Run "xv fig.xwd". Crop your figure as described in the last step of
the previous recipe. When you save your file, select "PBM/PGM/PPM (raw)"
as the output format, and change the filename to "fig.ppm".

\item
Convert the file to GIF format by running:
\begin{verbatim}
% pnmscale 1 fig.ppm | ppmquant 256 | ppmtogif > fig.gif
\end{verbatim}
To get an anti-aliased result, draw your figure larger than you want
it to appear, and use a value less than 1 in the argument to
pnmscale(1).
\end{enumerate}

In all of these recipes, the pnmscale(1) program is used to produce
anti-aliased figures. The quality of the anti-aliasing will be better
the larger the ratio between the input and output resolutions.

Since GIF is a pixmap file format, the size of your figure when it is
viewed over the web will depend on the resolution of the monitor on
which it is displayed. And monitor resolutions do vary. All Macintosh
monitors have a resolution of 72 dpi, while high-end monitors have
resolutions upwards of 100 dpi. The display resolutions of a PC system
can be anywhere in that range based on the system's display hardware.

\section{\anchor{CrashRecovery}{Crash Recovery}}

If Juno crashes (or if your system crashes) while you are working 
on a drawing, don't despair; chances are you have lost only a minute 
or so of work.  This is because Juno automatically saves the state 
of your drawing periodically.  After the crash, just run Juno again, 
giving as a command line argument the name of the file you were working 
on when the crash occurred.  For example, if you were working on 
"Untitled.juno" when the program crashed, just restart Juno with 
the command 

    Juno Untitled.juno

Juno will notice the checkpoint file and recover from it.  

To recover the checkpoint you have to start Juno with the lost file 
as a command-line argument; it won't work to start on some other 
file then open the lost file. 

Juno stores the checkpoint file in the same directory as the file 
you are editing.  The checkpoint file has the same base name as the 
file you are editing, and the extension ".bak".  This means that 
you should use different base names for your different drawings: 
if you tried to store three different drawings in the files "figure", 
"figure.juno", and "figure.foo", the checkpoint files for all of 
them would be in "figure.bak".  (Of course, if you only edit them 
one at a time, it won't make any difference that they share a checkpoint 
file).  If you don't name your drawing, Juno names it "Untitled.juno", 
and uses the backup file "Untitled.bak".  

Juno automatically deletes the checkpoint file if you successfully 
save your work, or whenever you explicitly discard your edits.  So 
if you see the file around, it means there was a crash while you 
were using Juno. 

When Juno uses a checkpoint file to recover, it pops up a window 
letting you know.  If for some reason you prefer the version in the 
".juno" file to the checkpoint version, just use the "Open" command 
to re-read the ".juno" file, overwriting the state recovered from 
the checkpoint. 

If you edit a file in a place where you do not have permission to 
write a checkpoint file, Juno silently gives up on automatic checkpointing.  
If a checkpoint file is found to be corrupted during recovery, recovery 
is silently abandoned. 

\section{\anchor{Mistakes}{Correcting Mistakes}}

Although Juno does not have a generalized ``undo'' facility, it does
provide three mechanisms for correcting mistakes.

First, the current command and current module editors record changes
to their contents, and they provide key bindings to undo changes. In
the \it{emacs} model, ``undo'' is bound to ``C-_''
(control-underscore); in the \it{ivy}, \it{mac}, and \it{xterm}
models, it is bound to ``C-z'' (control-z). See the description of
the \tt{TEXTPORTMODEL} environment variable below.

Second, you can abort the application of a tool before you have
supplied all its parameters by selecting another tool. In particular,
if you are using a point tool and make a mistake selecting one of its
arguments (other than the last one), you can start over by selecting
the same tool again from the tool palette.

Finally, you can always correct mistakes you make while editing
through the drawing by directly editing the current command. For
example, if you accidentally apply the \link{#GeomTools}{\it{Ver}}
tool when you intended to use the \link{#GeomTools}{\it{Hor}} tool,
you can change the appropriate occurrence of \tt{VER} to \tt{HOR}
in the current command and then click the
\link{#RunButton}{\it{Run} button} to effect the change.

\section{\anchor{ConfigValues}{Setting Configuration Values}}

Here are the configuration values, their types, and their meanings:

\begin{description}
\item{\bf{TextFont: Font}}
The font used for the text in most of the Juno-2 user interface,
including the names of menus, menu items, names of tools in the tool
palette, and error messages.

\item{\bf{CodeFont: Font}}
The font used to display Juno-2 source code. This should be a
fixed-width font.

\item{\bf{LabelFont: Font}}
The font used to display the names of points in the drawing view when
the \bf{Labels} menu item is set to \bf{Letters}.

\item{\bf{DotSize: REAL}}
The radius (in pixels) of the dots drawn with labeled points in the
drawing view.

\item{\bf{CrossSize: REAL}}
The ``radius'' of crosses drawn in the drawing view when the
\bf{Labels} menu item is set to \bf{Crosses}.

\item{\bf{ChkptIntv: CARDINAL}}
The interval (in seconds) between automatic checkpoints of the current
file.

\item{\bf{RealPrec: CARDINAL}}
The number of significant digits to which real numbers are
pretty-printed in the program view.

\item{\bf{PreviewCmd: TEXT}}
The command that is run to preview a PostScript file. The command may
include the special substrings ``$Display'', ``$Title'', and ``$Filename'',
which are replaced by the name of the X display on which Juno was run,
the title of the current Juno file, and the name of the PostScript
file to be previewed, respectively.

\item{\bf{PrintCmd: TEXT}}
The command that is run to print a PostScript file piped into it on standard
input. The command may include the special substring "$Title", which
is replaced by the title of the current Juno file.

\item{\bf{Origin: Identifier}}
The location of the origin in the drawing view. The two possible
origin values are ``\bf{center}'' and ``\bf{southwest}''. The former causes
the origin to be located at the center of the drawing window
and the center of output pages. The latter causes the origin
to be located in the southwest corner of the drawing window and output
pages.

\item{\bf{Orientation: Identifier}}
The orientation effects the default bounding box and orientation of the
image on PostScript output. The two possible orientations are
\bf{portrait} and \bf{landscape}. The former uses a
vertically-oriented 8.5" x 11" page, while the latter uses a
horizontally-oriented 8.5" x 11" page.
\end{description}

New configuration values can be \link{#ConfigOpt}{specified} in
configuration files. A Juno configuration file is a sequence of
symbolic expressions as defined in the Modula-3 \it{Sx} interface.
Each s-exp in the file specifies a single configuration value. Here is
the configuration file syntax. Strings in single quotes denote
literal characters.

\begin{verbatim}
File         ::= { '(' Cmd ')' }*
Cmd          ::= TextCmd | RealCmd | CardCmd | FontCmd
               | OrigCmd | OrientCmd
TextCmd      ::= TextCmdNames TextVal
TextCmdNames ::= 'PreviewCmd' | 'PrintCmd'
TextVal      ::= <Id> | <Text>
RealCmd      ::= RealCmdNames <Real>
RealCmdNames ::= 'DotSize'
CardCmd      ::= CardCmdNames <Cardinal>
CardCmdNames ::= 'CrossSize' | 'CheckpointIntv' | 'RealPrec'
FontCmd      ::= FontCmdNames FontSpec*
FontCmdNames ::= 'CodeFont' | 'TextFont' | 'LabelFont'
FontSpec     ::= LFontSpec | XFontSpec
LFontSpec    ::= '(' FontName FontWeight FontSize ')'
FontName     ::= TextVal
FontWeight   ::= 'medium' | 'bold'
FontSize     ::= <Cardinal>
XFontSpec    ::= <Text>
OrigCmd      ::= 'Origin' OrigVal
OrigVal      ::= 'center' | 'southwest'
OrientCmd    ::= 'Orientation' OrientVal
OrientVal    ::= 'portrait' | 'landscape'
\end{verbatim}

A FontCmd includes a list of FontSpec's. Juno will look for the fonts
in turn, and use the first one that is available on your X server.
There are two ways to specify a FontSpec: either as an X font name
(see xlsfonts(1) and xfontsel(1)), or as a triple specifying the name,
weight, and size of the font.

When you select the \bf{Configure...} menu command from the
\bf{Juno-2} menu, a dialog box appears displaying two files. The top,
read-only window displays the contents of a built-in configuration
file used to set the default configuration values. The bottom editable
window displays the contents of the configuration file that was read at
start-up (if any). To change the current configuration values, edit
the lower window and hit the "OK" button.

\section{\anchor{Zeus}{Interfacing with Zeus}}

Juno can be used as the server for a single view of the Zeus
animation system. To run Juno in this mode, you invoke it with the
\bf{-zeus} command-line option. Before doing so, however, you must
be sure the network object daemon is running on your machine. If you
haven't run one already, you can start a daemon by running the
program netobjd(1).

When you run Juno with \tt{-zeus}, a separate top-level animation
window appears. You can still use Juno for developing your animation
code, but when contacted by Zeus, all drawing is directed to the
animation window.

To implement the view in Juno, you simply define procedures in the
current module for each of your animation's events. Each time Zeus
issues an event, the event arguments are converted to Juno values,
and Juno calls the procedure in the current module with the same
name as the event.

To build a Zeus application that uses Juno to serve one of its
views, just add the lines:

\begin{flushleft}
\tt{zume(}<sessionName>\tt{)}\newline
\tt{junozume(}<sessionName>, <viewName>\tt{)}
\end{flushleft}

to the \tt{m3makefile} of your Zeus application. The
<sessionName> should be the name of the Zeus session (i.e. the
name of the event file), and <viewName> should be the name you
want installed in the Zeus ``Views'' menu. You should have at most
one ``\tt{junozume}'' line in your \tt{m3makefile}.

To run the animation, you must run the Zeus application on the same
machine as your Juno application and the network object daemon. Once
Zeus is running, you must click on the view named <viewName> in
the Zeus ``Views'' menu. You will get an error if you select this
view and there is no Juno running as a Zeus server on the same machine.

You can control the animation using the \it{Go}, \it{Step}, and
\it{Abort} buttons and the animation slider just like any other Zeus
view. The only difference is that the animation speed cannot be
changed during an event. If you change the slider during an event,
the new slider value won't take effect until the start of the next
event. While a Zeus animation is running (even if it is paused), the
main Juno window is inactive.

\section{\anchor{Errors}{Compilation Errors}}

When you click the \link{#RunButton}{\it{Run}} or
\link{#SolveButton}{\it{Solve}} button, Juno compiles the current
module and current command. If a compilation error occurs, Juno
highlights the section of code causing the error and then pops up a
window with an error message. You can click on the error window to
dismiss it.

Most of the compile-time error messages are self-explanatory. If you get
the error message ``Extra near constraints'', please see Appendix A,
\it{Constraint Solving}, of the Juno language definition.

\section{Run-time Errors}

Whenever Juno runs the current command --- for example, when you
apply a tool or click the \it{Run} button --- there is the chance
that your program contains a bug that results in a run-time
error. To signal a run-time error, Juno pops up a window with an
error message. You can click on the error window to dismiss it.

The error message window displays the name of the Juno procedure in
which the run-time error occurred, along with the class of the
error. There are four classes of run-time errors:

\begin{description}
\item{Executed ABORT}

Your program executed the \tt{ABORT} command, which is defined to cause
a run-time error.

\item{Guard failed}

Your program contains a command \tt{IF <cmd> FI} such that the guard
of the command <cmd> is false. Since Juno brackets the current command
with an implicit \tt{IF...FI}, this error message most likely indicates
that Juno was unable to solve the current command's
<constraint> for the <variables> from the initial values
given for those <variables>. 

\item{Undefined term}

Some term in your program was found to be undefined at run-time. For
each function in the Juno language, the language definition defines
the domain of values on which that function is defined. For example,
the ``+'' and ``/'' functions are defined only on two numbers;
moreover, ``/'' is undefined if its second argument (the
denominator) is 0.

\item{Built-in procedure <proc> failed}

A run-time error occurred in the built-in \tt{PS}, \tt{Text},
\tt{Time}, or \tt{Unit} procedure named \tt{<proc>}. This error is
usually caused by passing parameters to the procedure that don't
meet the procedure's preconditions. For example, the procedure
\tt{Text.Cat} will fail if either of its arguments is not a text,
and the procedure \tt{PS.SetWidth} will fail if its argument is not
a positive number. However, built-in procedures can fail in other
ways. For example, the procedures in the \tt{PS} module can fail if
you are previewing your drawing and kill the PostScript previewer
before the drawing is finished.
\end{description}

\section{\anchor{Environment}{Environment Variables}}

\begin{description}
\item{DISPLAY}
The X server and screen on which Juno's top-level windows appear.

\item{HOME}
The user's home directory used to search for the ".juno-config.sx"
configuration file.

\item{TEXTPORTMODEL}
The editing model for the current command and current module editors.
The editing model determines the key bindings and selection gestures
for these editors. The recognized values are \it{ivy}, \it{emacs},
\it{mac}, and \it{xterm}. If this variable is undefined, the editing model
defaults to \it{emacs}.
\end{description}

Other environment variables may be used by the commands specified in
the configuration file to preview and print PostScript output.

\section{\anchor{Files}{Files}}

\begin{description}
\item{./Untitled.juno}
Initial contents of current module editor if no other file is
specified on the command-line.

\item{./.juno-config.sx, $HOME/.juno-config.sx}
Juno configuration files read if \bf{-config} is not specified on the
command line.
\end{description}

\section{\anchor{Bugs}{Bugs}}

Here are the known bugs in the current version:

\begin{itemize}
\item Some configuration values set in the \bf{Configuration...}
dialogue may not take effect immediately. You may have to reshape the
drawing and program views by dragging the middle vertical bar to see
new values for the CodeFont, LabelFont, DotSize, and CrossSize
configuration variables.

\item If you invoke ``undo'' in either the current module or the
current command editor, it is not noticed by Juno as a change to the
program source. Hence, the \it{Solve} button is not activated.

\item The compiler does not propagate hints through to pairs. For
example, in the command:
\begin{verbatim}
  VAR a ~ (1,2), x, y IN
    a ~ (x, y) AND x * x = 2 -> SKIP
  END
\end{verbatim}
the variable \tt{a} gets a hint, but the two components of that hint
are not passed on to \tt{x} and \tt{y}. This bug is sometimes
revealed when the compiler issues an unexpected ``Extra near
constraints'' compile-time error message; however, in other cases,
the compiler silently produces code that Juno will fail to solve,
usually resulting in a ``Guard Failed'' run-time error message.

\item If you use the \tt{PS.SetBBox} tool to set a new bounding
box, Juno fails to change the bounding-box annotation in the
drawing view. To see the correct annotation, just click the
\it{Run} button, or \it{Drag} or \it{Adjust} either of the
bounding-box points.

\item Juno automatically pretty-prints the current module and
command to fit within the margins. But sometimes it gets the width
wrong.

\item Juno does nothing to explicitly handle floating point
underflows and overflows. Its response to floating-point exceptions
varies between architectures.

\item Juno implicitly recompiles your program in response to certain
user actions. Sometimes, it does not deactivate the \it{Solve}
button when it should.

\item Applying the \tt{PS.Fill} tool does not erase the red outline
annotation of the current path, even though the current path is
reset by \tt{PS.Fill}.

\item The path returned by \tt{PS.CurrentPath} may not correspond
exactly to the current path; its coordinates may be slightly
different, since the path is represented in terms of the integral
pixel coordinates of the points.

\item Juno crashes if you try to draw a point too far outside the
image page. This is due to a bug in the X server.

\item When printing a Juno drawing on a PostScript device, you may
get a ``limitcheck'' error if your drawing contains a path that is
too large (i.e., contains too many points). The workaround is to
modify your Juno program to break the path into smaller parts and to
stroke or fill the separate pieces.
\end{itemize}

\section{\anchor{Shortcomings}{Shortcomings}}

The current version has several shortcomings that we hope to address
in future versions. They are:

\begin{itemize}
\item When a run-time error occurs, there is no visual indication as
to where it occurred. Run-time errors should be highlighted in the
program, just like compilation errors.

\item There is no convenient way to enter values through the drawing
view other than points, texts, and arguments to set tools.

\item There are no provisions for scaled or rotated fonts.

\item There is no way to zoom or pan the drawing view.

\item There is no convenient ``unfold'' mechanism.

\item You may only name built-in modules in the \tt{IMPORT}
declaration, and you may only refer to imported modules in qualified
identifiers. However, if your current module does not include an
\tt{IMPORT} declarations, all of the built-in modules are imported
implicitly.

\item It would be nice to be able to adjust a group of points at
once.

\item It should be possible to set the page \link{#Orientation}{orientation}
on a per-drawing basis, rather than simply for the entire run of the
Juno application. However, you can change the current orientation
using the \bf{Configuration...} command under the \bf{Juno-2} menu.
\end{itemize}

\section{\anchor{ReportingBugs}{Reporting Bugs}}

If you notice a bug not described in the \link{#Bugs}{Bugs} or
\link{#Shortcomings}{Shortcomings} sections, please send a bug
report to \tt{heydon@src.dec.com}. If the bug you are reporting
caused Juno to crash, please include a pointer to the ``core'' file
in your message. Sometimes, Juno writes debugging information to
standard error before it crashed; please include such output in your
message. Also, any description of what you were doing to cause the
error would be very much appreciated.
