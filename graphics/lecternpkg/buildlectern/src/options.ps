% Lectern:
%   A PostScript prolog to set GhostScript options useful for BuildLectern.

% Once Ghostscript 3.x has been universally adopted, we could use the "-c"
% command-line option instead of loading this prolog from a file.

% Force the identity transfer function (Ghostscript currently uses gamma=1.25
% when the output device has resolution of 150DPI or more).
{} settransfer


% Force the save level to be greater than zero.  This works around a bug
% in PostScript in GlobalMode/LocalMode produced by VAX DOCUMENT 2.0.
% In principle, we should do a restore after processing the user input.
/BuildLecternSave save def

% We'd like to have a way to override the effect of a PostScript job
% setting #copies or the /NumCopies page device key to zero.  Until we
% get such a mechanism, we set /NumCopies to one, which will override
% a Level 1 job that sets #copies to zero.
/languagelevel where { pop languagelevel 2 ge } { false } ifelse 
  { << /NumCopies 1 >> setpagedevice } if
