See
Lectern(1)
for the interpretation of the arguments.  When LecternClient is called with a
single pathname, it is made absolute if necessary (by prefixing it with the
pathname of the current working directory) and passed to Lectern. When
LecternClient is called with the \fB\-f\fR option, its single argument is interpreted
as the name of a file containing one or more lines, each of which is passed
unchanged to Lectern. When LecternClient is called with the \fB\-l\fR option, its
remaining arguments are passed uninterpreted to Lectern.
