AlgFFSimple -- First-first binpacking. Doesn't respond to any feedback
  events.

AlgFFCodeView -- First-first binpacking. Doesn't respond to any
  feedback events. Does generate events for code view, and traces for
  variable view. 

AlgFFPromptForWeights.m3 -- First-first binpacking. Doesn't respond to any
   feedback events. Pauses to wait for the user to enter a new weight 
   interactively. Illustrates use of ZeusPanel.StartFeedback and 
   ZeusPaonel.EndFeedback, as a way to poll the user.

AlgFF.m3 -- First-first binpacking.  Responds to feedback events
  TryToDeleteWeight and TryToEmptyBin. Algorithm's input panel 
  allows user to specify a weight to delete and a bin to empty.

BinpackDataView.m3 -- Registers the Zeus variable view. (This should 
  be done automatically by Zeus, just as code views do not need
  to be explicitly registered.)

alg.c -- Data file read by code view; contains C source code.

binpackFFvar.fv  -- The form used by the data view.

binpackinput.fv -- A simple data form for giving input to binpacking
  algorithms. Used by AlgFFSimple, AlgFFCodeView, and AlgFF. The form
  also has interactors for specifying a bin to empty or a weight to 
  delete. However, this part of the form is dormant by default, and
  only AlgFF makes use of it.

binpackprompt.fv -- A data form used by AlgFFPromptForWeights to 
  prompt the user for information along the way.

Binpack.evt -- The events for binpacking algorithms.

Main.m3 -- Boilerplate to mainline to drive Zeus. 

PackingView1 -- A very simple view that shows the packing
  of the weights. The view is non-pickable, and doesn't not respond 
  to the "RepackBin" update event for an algorithm.

PackingView2 -- Like PackingView1, but also responds to the 
   "RepackBin" update event.  As such, the implementation is more
   complex because it must maintain a list of the display objects
   corresponding to each weight.

PackingView3 -- A subclass of PackingView2 that shows the 
   probe event. 

PackingView4 -- A subclass of PackingView3 with the mouse
   and position method overriden so that when the user clicks
   on a weight, a feedback event goes to the algorithm to delete
   that weight.
