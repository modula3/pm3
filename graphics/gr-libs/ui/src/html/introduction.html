<P>
This report is a programmer's reference manual for Trestle, a Modula-3
window system toolkit.  
<P>
Trestle has been implemented over two
underlying window systems: X <A HREF="references.html#XSpec"> [XSpec] </A> 
and the native Firefly <A HREF="references.html#6"> [Firefly] </A> window system
developed at SRC. Other implementations are possible, but at
present the only widely available implementation is Trestle-on-X.  
<P>
To use Trestle-on-X, you need a Modula-3 compiler and an X server for
your system. The Trestle code is an application library layered on top
of Xlib, the standard X client library. Trestle applications obey X's
ICCCM protocol for cooperating with the window manager and other
applications, so you can use your favorite window manager and mix
Trestle applications freely with other X applications.  
<P>
The reference
manual is self-contained but non-tutorial; you would do well to read
the <I>Trestle Tutorial first</I> <A HREF="references.html#4"> [TTut] </A> 
(Chapter 7). 
We assume you are familiar with Modula-3 <A HREF="references.html#1"> [M3a] </A>
<A HREF="references.html#2"> [M3b] </A><A HREF="references.html#4"> [M3c] </A>.
<P> 
<B>The Trestle abstraction</B>. A
<TT>Trestle.T</TT> is a connection to a window system. The window system is
assumed to have a keyboard, a pointing device, and one or more display
screens. For example, in Trestle-on-X, a <TT>Trestle.T</TT> is implemented by a
connection to an X server.  
<P>
Each screen is a raster display, whose
image is stored in a frame buffer containing a rectangular array of
pixels. Changing the contents of a frame buffer is called <I>painting</I> ,
since it changes the image displayed to the user. The different
screens can be of different types (e.g., color or black and white).
<P>
Trestle imposes an <TT>hv</TT>-coordinate system on each display screen, in
which the <TT>h</TT> coordinate increases from left to right and the <TT>v</TT>
coordinate increases from top to bottom. The <TT>Trestle</TT> interface allows
you to determine the number of screens and also their types,
dimensions, and the positions of their coordinate origins.  
<P>
We will
call the pointing device the mouse, although it might be a stylus or
other instrument. The mouse generally has one or more buttons that the
user can click down and up.  
<P>
The system displays a <I>cursor</I> , a small
arrow or other image that points at some pixel of some screen. By
moving the mouse the user can move the cursor around the screen or
from one screen to another. Applications can change the shape of the
cursor to convey information to the user.  
<P>
The complete <TT>Trestle</TT>
interface is described in Section 3.
<P>
<B>The VBT abstraction</B>. The key abstraction in Trestle is the "virtual
bitmap terminal" or <TT>VBT</TT>. A <TT>VBT</TT> represents 
a share of the keyboard,
mouse, and displays. <TT>VBT</TT>s are comparable to the windows, widgets, and
viewers of other systems.  
<P>
An application is generally organized as a
tree of <TT>VBT</TT>s, with the root <TT>VBT</TT> representing the top-level
application window. The internal nodes are called <I>split</I> <TT>VBT</TT>s or
<I>parent</I> <TT>VBT</TT>s: they divide their 
screens between one or more child <TT>VBT</TT>s 
according to some layout depending on the class of split. At the
leaves of the tree are <TT>VBT</TT>s that contain no subwindows.
<P>
A typical application consists of a number of leaf <TT>VBT</TT>s whose
behavior is specific to that application, together with some more leaf
<TT>VBT</TT>s that provide buttons, scrollbars, and other "interactors", all
held together by a tree of splits that define the geometric layout. A
split with only one child is called a <I>filter</I> . For example, a
<TT>BorderedVBT</TT> is a filter that adds a border around the child's
screen. A split that can have more than one child is called a <I>proper
split</I>. For example, an <TT>HVSplit</TT> 
is a split in which the children are
laid out horizontally or vertically.  
<P>
Sections 4, 5, and 6 describe
Trestle's built-in proper splits, filters, and leaves.
<P>
To obtain a
share of a Trestle display, an application creates a <TT>VBT</TT> and
"installs" it with the procedure <TT>Trestle.Install</TT>, which allocates
some portion of some display to the <TT>VBT</TT>, within which the application
can paint. The <TT>VBT</TT> is said to be <I>installed</I> 
and is called a <I>top-level window</I>. 
The size and position of top-level windows depends on the
arguments to <TT>Trestle.Install</TT> and on the whim of the window manager.
<P>
A <TT>VBT</TT> imposes an <TT>hv</TT>-coordinate system on its screen. 
A top-level <TT>VBT</TT>'s
coordinate system need not be the same as the coordinate system of the
screen on which it is installed. The translation between the two
coordinate systems can be determined through the <TT>Trestle.ScreenOf</TT>
procedure.  
<P>
In a split <TT>VBT</TT>, the translation between the parent and
child coordinate systems depends on the class of the split. Trestle
provides one filter (<TT>TranslateVBT</TT>) whose sole purpose is to position
the child coordinate system origin at the northwest corner of the
child's domain, since this is convenient for some applications. All
the other built-in splits make the child coordinate system agree with
the parent coordinate system, since this is usually the most
convenient.  
<P>
Information flows through a <TT>VBT</TT> in two
directions. Painting commands travel from the leaves of the tree
towards the root. Events like mouse clicks and cursor positions travel
from the root towards the leaves. A <TT>VBT</TT> is an object with methods for
handling events; to deliver an event to a <TT>VBT</TT>, the system invokes the
appropriate method. The <TT>VBT</TT> interface in Section 2 specifies the
event-handling methods and the painting procedures.  
<P>
The screen of a
<TT>VBT</TT> is <I>forgetful</I>; 
that is, its contents can be lost at any time, at
which point the system activates its <TT>repaint</TT> method, which is expected
to repaint what has been lost. Similarly, the height, width, and
coordinate origin of a <TT>VBT</TT>'s screen can change at any time, in which
case the system activates its <TT>reshape</TT> method. Finally, the type of the
pixels in a <TT>VBT</TT>'s screen can change (e.g., from color to monochrome),
in which case the system activates its <TT>rescreen</TT> method. These events
reflect the fact that the user of the window system can expose
portions of a top-level window, reshape top-level windows, and move
top-level windows from one display to another.
<P>
<B>Selections and event-time</B>. From the user's point of view, a selection
is a highlighted occurrence of text or other data that can be made in
a window via some gesture, such as sweeping with the mouse. Selections
are supported to make it easy for users to cut and paste text and
other data between windows. A particular selection is always in at
most one window at a time, namely the "owner" of the selection. If a
selection is in no window at all, its owner is <TT>NIL</TT>.
<P>
From the programmer's point of view, the selection owner is a 
<TT>VBT</TT>-valued 
variable shared between all applications. The procedure
<TT>VBT.Acquire</TT> is used to acquire a selection. Whenever a 
<TT>VBT</TT> acquires a
selection, the previous owner is notified, so that it can take down
any highlighting or other feedback. Any <TT>VBT</TT> can own a selection, not
just a top-level window.  
<P>
The procedures <TT>VBT.Read</TT> and <TT>VBT.Write</TT> are
used to read or write the value of the selection. Calls to <TT>Read</TT> and
<TT>Write</TT> are implemented by locating the selection owner (which could be
in the same address space as the caller to <TT>Read</TT> or <TT>Write</TT>, 
or in a
different address space) and activating its <TT>read</TT> or <TT>write</TT>
method,
which is responsible for doing the work. The selection values
communicated by <TT>Read</TT> and <TT>Write</TT> can be of any type 
that can be pickled
(see Section 3.6 of <I>Systems Programming with Modula-3</I> 
<A HREF="references.html#4"> [SPwM3] </A>); in
particular, they can be of type <TT>TEXT</TT>.  
<P>
The <TT>VBT</TT> to which user
keystrokes are directed is called the <I>keyboard focus</I>. Some window
managers define the focus to be the window containing the cursor;
other window managers move the focus in response to mouse
clicks. Trestle applications work with either kind of window manager.
<P>
Trestle classifies the keyboard focus as a selection, since it is a
global <TT>VBT</TT>-valued variable that can be acquired and released. If you
want to receive keystrokes, you must acquire the focus. If this
succeeds, you should provide some feedback to the user, for example by
displaying a blinking caret. (Even if the window manager is
identifying the top-level window containing the focus, you should
still let the user know which subwindow contains the focus.) When you
are notified that you have lost the focus, you should take down the
feedback.  
<P>
It is also possible to send any selection owner a
"miscellaneous code", which will be delivered by activating the <TT>misc</TT>
method in the owner. For example, the way that Trestle notifies a
window that it no longer owns a selection is by sending it a
miscellaneous code of type <TT>Lost</TT>. Miscellaneous codes are also used
for other purposes; for example, to notify windows that they have been
deleted.
<P>
<B>The event-time protocol</B>. There are many potential race conditions
involving selec- tions. For example, suppose that the user clicks in
window <TT>A</TT> , expecting it to acquire the keyboard focus. But window <TT>A</TT> is
slow; perhaps it is paging or blocked in a call to a server that is
being debugged; and does not respond. So the user clicks in another
window <TT>B</TT> , which acquires the keyboard focus, and types away. A few
minutes later, window <TT>A</TT> comes to life and grabs the keyboard
focus. Suddenly and unexpectedly the user's typing is redirected to <TT>A</TT>
instead of <TT>B</TT> . Similar race conditions can occur with selections other
than the keyboard focus; for example, you select a file name, then
activate a delete command by clicking, then wonder how long you must
wait before it is safe to make another selection.  
<P>
Trestle uses the
<I>event-time protocol</I> to deal with these race conditions. This means
that Trestle keeps track of the <I>current event time</I>, which is the
timestamp of the last keystroke, mouseclick, or miscellaneous code
that has been delivered to any <TT>VBT</TT>.  Attempts to read, write, or
acquire a selection must be accompanied by a timestamp, and if this
timestamp does not agree with the current event time, the attempt
fails. This guarantees that only <TT>VBT</TT>s that are responding to the
user's latest action can access the selections.  
<P>
When Trestle
activates a window's method to deliver it an event, it generally waits
for the method to return before it delivers any events to any other
windows.  This gives the window a fair chance to use the time stamp in
the event to access the selections. However, if the method takes an
unreasonably long time; more than a few seconds; Trestle may give up on
the window and start delivering events to other windows anyway.  
<P>
As a consequence, if you must do a long-running computation in response to
a user event, then you should fork the computation in a separate
thread and return from the method promptly, to avoid delaying the
user, who may want to click in another window.  You should also do any
operations that require accessing the selections from the main thread
before the method returns, since an event-time operation in the forked
thread will fail if the user has continued typing or clicking during
the forked computation.
<P>
<B>The geometry interfaces</B>. The interfaces <TT>Axis</TT>, <TT>Point</TT>, 
<TT>Rect</TT>, <TT>Region</TT>, 
<TT>Trapezoid</TT>, and <TT>Path</TT> are explained in Section 8. In brief,
<TT>Axis.T.Hor</TT> and <TT>Axis.T.Ver</TT> name the horizontal and vertical coordinate
axes; a <TT>Point.T</TT> (or simply a point ) is a pair of integers
representing a point in the plane; a <TT>Rect.T</TT> is a rectangle of points
whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes; a <TT>Region.T</TT> is an
arbitrary set of points represented as a sorted array of rectangles; a
<TT>Trapezoid.T</TT> is a set of points bounded by two horizontal lines and two
lines with arbitrary slopes; and a <TT>Path.T</TT> is a path in the plane
represented by a sequence of straight and curved segments.
<P>
<B>Resources</B>. A <I>pixmap</I> is a rectangular array of pixels. 
A <I>bitmap</I> is a
pixmap in which the pixels are one bit deep. For example, a large
pixmap could represent a photographic image; a small bitmap could
represent a cursor shape. Trestle also uses a pixmap to represent the
infinite texture that results from tiling the plane with translations
of the pixmap. Thus whether a pixmap represents an infinite texture or
a bounded image depends only on the context in which it is used.  
<P>
A <I>font</I> is a typeface suitable for painting text.  
<P>
A <I>painting operation</I>
is an operation code for changing the values of pixels in the frame
buffer of a display screen.  
<P>
Pixmaps, cursor shapes, fonts, and
painting operations are collectively called <I>resources</I>. Resources come
in both <I>screen-independent</I> and <I>screen-dependent</I> forms.  A
screen-independent resource varies with the screentype to produce a
similar effect on all types of screens. For example, two important
screen-independent painting operations are <TT>PaintOp.Fg</TT> and <TT>PaintOp.Bg</TT>,
which set pixels to a screen's foreground and background colors. In
contrast, a screen-dependent resource is useful only on a particular
screentype. If it is used on a <TT>VBT</TT> with the wrong type of screen, the
system won't crash, but the effect will be non-deterministic; a
screen-dependent painting operation that blackens a pixel on a
black-and-white screen might set a 24-bit pixel to chartreuse on a
true-color screen.  
<P>
Screen-independent resources are convenient, but
screen-dependent resources are sometimes necessary for exploiting the
capabilities of specific display hardware.
<P>
The screen-independent resource types are called <TT>Pixmap.T</TT>, 
<TT>Cursor.T</TT>, <TT>Font.T</TT>, and <TT>PaintOp.T</TT>. 
The interfaces where these types are defined
also provide procedures for generating useful resources. For
example, <TT>PaintOp.FromRGB</TT> will produce a screen-independent painting
operation that sets a pixel to a particular color; <TT>Font.FromName</TT> will
produce a screen-independent font given the name of the typeface.  
<P>
The
corresponding screen-dependent resources are <TT>ScrnPixmap.T</TT> , 
<TT>ScrnCursor.T</TT>, <TT>ScrnFont.T</TT>, and <TT>ScrnPaintOp.T</TT>. 
The interfaces where these
types are defined also specify the representations of the raw values;
the layout of pixmaps in memory, the attributes of fonts, and similar
details that all sane people prefer to avoid.  
<P>
Converting a
screen-independent resource into the corresponding screen-dependent
resource for a particular type of screen is called <I>resolving</I> the
resource. The <TT>Palette</TT> interface will give you a screen-independent
resource if you give it a closure for resolving the resource. You can
therefore use the Palette interface to construct your own
screen-independent resources. For example, you could produce a 
(<TT>PaintOp.T</TT>, <TT>Font.T</TT>) 
pair that produces red Times Roman text on a
color display and black italic text on a black-and-white display; or a
<TT>Pixmap.T</TT> that selects between a low and a high resolution bitmap
depending on the screen resolution.  
<P>
The closure for resolving the
resource will be invoked automatically when a top-level window moves
to a new screentype for the first time. The closure will be passed an
argument of type <TT>ScreenType.T</TT>, which represents a type of display
screen. A <TT>ScreenType.T</TT> determines the depth of the screen's pixels
(e.g., one or eight), the method for associating a color with a pixel
value (e.g., color-mapped or true-color), the set of allowed
operations on its pixels, and the repositories for screen-dependent
fonts, cursors, and pixmaps that can be used on the screen.
<P>
<B>Implementing your own splits</B>. Most applications can be built by using
Trestle's built-in splits and leaves, together with one or more leaf
<TT>VBT</TT>s specific to the application. If you are programming a more
sophisticated application, you may want to augment the built-in splits
with some of your own. Section 9 introduces the interfaces that allow
you to do this.  
<P>
To implement a leaf <TT>VBT</TT>, you only have to supply
methods to handle the events that flow down the tree (from the root to
the leaves). To implement a split <TT>VBT</TT>, you also have to supply
methods to handle the information that flows up the tree, such as
painting commands or commands to change the cursor shape. The <TT>VBTClass</TT>
interface declares these methods and presents their specifications.
<P>
Very few splits override the method for painting, since the default
behavior, which is to clip to the child's domain and relay the
painting to the parent, is usually what is desired. But some splits do
override this method: for example, the <TT>ZSplit</TT>, whose child windows
are allowed to overlap one another, has a paint method that clips its
children's painting to the visible parts of their domains. And the top
level window has a painting method that translates <TT>VBT</TT> painting
commands into X painting commands and relays them to the X server. The
interfaces <TT>Batch</TT>, <TT>BatchUtil</TT>, and <TT>PaintPrivate</TT> 
reveal the details
necessary to override painting methods.
<P>
The remainder of the reference manual consists of complete Modula-3
interfaces printed in typewriter font and interspersed with commentary
printed in roman font.  Some of the commentary is in the form of
"pseudo-Modula-3" program fragments, which are also printed in
typewriter font.  
<P>
The Trestle release that accompanies SRC Modula-3
version 2.0 contains several interfaces that are not documented in
this reference manual. For example, the <TT>VTextVBT</TT> interface provides
editable text <TT>VBT</TT>s and the <TT>TrestleAux</TT> interface allows you to set
window manager parameters and do strange things to top-level
windows. The specifications for these interfaces are directly in the
Modula-3 interface files.
<P>
