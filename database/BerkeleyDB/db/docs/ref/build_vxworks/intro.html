<h1 align=center>Building for VxWorks</h1>
<p>The build_vxworks directory in the Berkeley DB distribution contains a workspace
and project files for Tornado 2.0.  The Berkeley DB distribution also contains
component files for Tornado 3.1/VxWorks AE.  See
<a href="../../ref/build_vxworks/introae.html">Building for VxWorks AE</a> for
information about VxWorks AE.

<h3>Building With Tornado 2.0</h3>
<p>Open the workspace <b>Berkeley DB.wsp</b>.  The list of projects
in this workspace will be shown.  These projects were created for
the x86 BSP for VxWorks.
<p>The remainder of this document assumes that you already have a
VxWorks target and a target server, both up and running.  It also
assumes that your VxWorks image is configured properly for your
needs.  It also assumes that you
have an acceptable file system already available.  See
<a href="../../ref/build_vxworks/faq.html">VxWorks FAQ</a> for more
information about file system requirements.
<p>First, you need to set the include directories.  To do this, go to the
<i>Builds</i> tab for the workspace.  Open up <i>Berkeley DB
Builds</i>.  You will see several different builds, containing different
configurations.  All of the projects in the Berkeley DB workspace are created
to be downloadable applications.
<p><table border=1 align=center>
<tr><th>Build</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>    <td align=left>PENTIUM_debug</td>    <td align=left>x86 BSP with debugging</td>    </tr>
<tr>    <td align=left>PENTIUM_nodebug</td>    <td align=left>x86 BSP no debugging</td>    </tr>
</table>
<p>You have to add a new build specification if you use a
different BSP, want to add a build for the simulator or
want to customize further.  For instance, if you have the Power PC (PPC)
BSP, you need to add a new build for the PPC tool chain.  To do so,
select the "Builds" tab, select the Berkeley DB project name, and right-click.
Choose the <i>New Build...</i> selection and create the new build
target.  For your new build target, you need to decide whether
it should be built for
debugging.  See the properties of the Pentium builds for ways to
configure for each case.  After you add this build you, you still need
to configure correctly the include directories, as described in the
sections that follow.
<p>If you are running with a different
BSP, you should remove the build specifications that do not apply to
your hardware.  We recommend that you do this after you configure any
new build specifications first.  The Tornado tools will get confused if
you have a PENTIUMgnu build specification for a PPC BSP,
for instance.
<p>Select the build you are interested in, and right-click.  Choose the
<i>Properties...</i> selection.  At this point, a tabbed dialog
should appear.  In this new window, choose the <i>C/C++ compiler</i>
tab.  In the edit box, you need to modify the full pathname of the
<i>build_vxworks</i> subdirectory of Berkeley DB, followed by the full
pathname of the <i>include</i> and <i>include_auto</i>
subdirectories of Berkeley DB.  Then, click OK.
<p>Note that some versions of Tornado (such as the version for Windows)
do not correctly handle relative pathnames in the include paths.
If you get an error about an inability to find header files
you should edit the <i>include</i> and <i>include_auto</i>
pathnames to remove the <i>build_vxworks/..</i> relative
portion.  Then you should rebuild your dependencies.
<p>To build and download the Berkeley DB downloadable application for the first time
requires several steps: 
<p><ol>
<p><li>Select the build you are interested in, and right-click.  Choose the
<i>Set... as Active Build</i> selection.
<p><li>Select the build you are interested in, and right-click.  Choose the
<i>Dependencies...</i> selection.  Run dependencies over all files
in the Berkeley DB project.
<p><li>Select the build you are interested in, and right-click.  Choose the
<i>Rebuild All (Berkeley DB.out)</i> selection.
<p><li>Select the Berkeley DB project name, and right-click.  Choose the
<i>Download "Berkeley DB.out"</i> selection.
</ol>
<p>You need to repeat this procedure for all builds you are interested in
building, as well as for all of the utility project builds you want to
run.
