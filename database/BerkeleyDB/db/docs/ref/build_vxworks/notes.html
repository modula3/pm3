<h1 align=center>VxWorks notes</h1>
<p>Berkeley DB currently disallows the DB_TRUNC flag to <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a>.  The
operations that this flag represents are not fully supported under
VxWorks.
<p>The <a href="../../api_c/db_sync.html">DB-&gt;sync</a> function is implemented using an ioctl call into
the file system driver with the FIOSYNC command.  Most, but not all file
system drivers support this call.  Berkeley DB requires the use of a file
system supporting FIOSYNC.
<h3>Building and Running the Demo Program</h3>
<p>The demo program should be built in a manner very similar to
building Berkeley DB.  If you want different or additional BSP
build specifications you should add them by following the
directions indicated in <a href="../../ref/build_vxworks/intro.html">Building
with Tornado 2.0</a> or <a href="../../ref/build_vxworks/introae.html">Building
with Tornado 3.1</a>.
<p>The demo program can be downloaded and run by calling the entry function
<b>dbdemo</b> with the pathname of a database to use.  The demo
program will ask for some input keys.  It creates a database and adds
those keys into the database, using the reverse of the key as the data
value.  When complete you can either enter EOF (control-D) or
<b>quit</b> and the demo program will display all of the key/data
items in the database.
<h3>Building and Running the Utility Programs</h3>
<p>The Berkeley DB  <a href="../../utility/index.html">utility programs</a>
can be downloaded and run by calling the
function equivalent to the utility's name.  The utility functions take
a string containing all the supported arguments.  The program will then
decompose that string into a traditional argc/argv used internally.
For example, to execute <a href="../../utility/db_stat.html">db_stat</a> on a database within an
environment you would execute the following from the windsh prompt.
Obviously you would change the pathname and database name to reflect
your system.
<p><blockquote><pre>-&gt; db_stat "-h /tmp/myenvhome -d mydatabase.db"</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Notes for VxWorks 5.4</h3>
<p>The memory on VxWorks is always resident and fully shared among all
tasks running on the target.  For this reason, the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_SYSTEM_MEM">DB_SYSTEM_MEM</a>
flag is implied for any application that does not specify the
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a> flag.  Additionally, applications must use a segment
ID to ensure that different applications do not overwrite each other's
database environments.  See the <a href="../../api_c/env_set_shm_key.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_shm_key</a> method for more
information.  Also, the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_LOCKDOWN">DB_LOCKDOWN</a> flag has no effect.
<h3>Notes for VxWorks AE 1.1</h3>
<p>All tasks wishing to access a particular environment must run in
the same application domain.  The memory regions used by the
environment are only accessible to the application domain.
If more than one application domain attempts to access an
environment simultaneously, the results are undefined but will
likely lead to corruption.
