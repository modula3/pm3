<h1 align=center>Log file only clients</h1>
<p>Applications wanting to use replication to support recovery after
catastrophic failure of the master may want to configure a site as a
logs-file-only replica.  Such clients cannot respond to read (or write)
queries but they still receive a complete copy the log files, so that in the
event of master failure, a copy of the logs is available.
<p>Log file only clients are configured like other client sites, except
they should specify the <a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html#DB_REP_LOGSONLY">DB_REP_LOGSONLY</a> flag to the
<a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a> method and should specify a priority of 0 to the
<a href="../../api_c/rep_elect.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_elect</a> method.
<p>There are two ways to recover using a log-file-only replica.
The simplest way is to copy the log files from the log-file-only
replica onto another site (either master or replica) and run catastrophic
recovery there.  If that is not an option, then
recovery must be run on the log-file-only replica, using the log files
that have accumulated there.
If the log files are entirely
self-contained, that is, they start with log file number 1, then a log
replica can simply run catastrophic recovery.  Obviously, if there are
a large number of log files in this case, recovery may take a long time.
If the log files are not self-contained, an archival copy of the
databases must first be restored onto the replica before running
catastrophic recovery.  In the latter case (that is, running recovery
on the log-file-only replica), once the site returns to being a log-file-only
replica, the database files on the log-file-only replica should be removed,
and if the log files do not begin with log file number 1,
a new set of archival databases should be created from
the current master.
<p>More specifically, the log files accumulating on the log-file-only
replica can take the place of the log files described in
<i>catastrophic recovery</i> section of the
<a href="../../ref/transapp/recovery.html">Recovery procedures</a> Berkeley DB
Reference Guide.
<p>In all other ways, a log-file-only site behaves as other replication
clients do.  It should have a thread or process receiving messages and
passing them to <a href="../../api_c/rep_message.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_process_message</a> and must respond to all returns
described for that interface.
