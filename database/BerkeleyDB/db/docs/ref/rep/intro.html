<h1 align=center>Introduction</h1>
<p>Berkeley DB includes support for building highly available applications based
on replication.  Berkeley DB replication groups consist of some number of
independently configured database environments.  There is a single
<i>master</i> database environment and one or more <i>client</i>
database environments.  Master environments support both database reads
and writes; client environments support only database reads.  If the
master environment fails, applications may upgrade a client to be the
new master.  The database environments might be on separate computers,
on separate hardware partitions in a non-uniform memory access (NUMA)
system, or on separate disks in a single server.  As always with Berkeley DB
environments, any number of concurrent processes or threads may access
a database environment.  In the case of a master environment, any number
of threads of control may read and write the environment, and in the
case of a client environment, any number of threads of control may read
the environment.
<p>Applications may be written to provide various degrees of consistency
between the master and clients.  The system can be run synchronously
such that replicas are guaranteed to be up-to-date with all committed
transactions, but doing so may incur a significant performance penalty.
Higher performance solutions sacrifice total consistency, allowing the
clients to be out of date for an application-controlled amount of time.
<p>While Berkeley DB includes the database infrastructure necessary to construct
highly available database environments, applications must still provide
some critical components:
<p><ol>
<p><li>The application is responsible for providing the communication
infrastructure.  Applications may use whatever wire protocol is
appropriate for their application (for example, RPC, TCP/IP, UDP, VI or
message-passing over the backplane).
<p><li>The application is responsible for naming.  Berkeley DB refers to the members
of a replication group using an application-provided ID, and
applications must map that ID to a particular database environment or
communication channel.
<p><li>The application is responsible for monitoring the status of the master
and clients, and identifying any unavailable database environments.
<p><li>The application must provide whatever security policies are needed.
For example, the application may choose to encrypt data, use a secure
socket layer, or do nothing at all.  The level of security is left to
the sole discretion of the application.
</ol>
