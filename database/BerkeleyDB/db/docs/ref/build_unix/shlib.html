<h1 align=center>Dynamic shared libraries</h1>
<p><b>Warning</b>: the following information is intended to be generic and
is likely to be correct for most UNIX systems.  Unfortunately, dynamic
shared libraries are not standard between UNIX systems, so there may be
information here that is not correct for your system.  If you have
problems, consult your compiler and linker manual pages, or your system
administrator.
<p>The Berkeley DB dynamic shared libraries are created with the name
libdb-<b>major</b>.<b>minor</b>.so, where <b>major</b> is the major
version number and <b>minor</b> is the minor version number.  Other
shared libraries are created if Java and Tcl support are enabled --
specifically, libdb_java-<b>major</b>.<b>minor</b>.so and
libdb_tcl-<b>major</b>.<b>minor</b>.so.
<p>On most UNIX systems, when any shared library is created, the linker
stamps it with a "SONAME".  In the case of Berkeley DB, the SONAME is
libdb-<b>major</b>.<b>minor</b>.so.  It is important to realize that
applications linked against a shared library remember the SONAMEs of the
libraries they use and not the underlying names in the filesystem.
<p>When the Berkeley DB shared library is installed, links are created in the
install lib directory so that libdb-<b>major</b>.<b>minor</b>.so,
libdb-<b>major</b>.so, and libdb.so all refer to the same library.  This
library will have an SONAME of libdb-<b>major</b>.<b>minor</b>.so.
<p>Any previous versions of the Berkeley DB libraries that are present in the
install directory (such as libdb-2.7.so or libdb-2.so) are left unchanged.
(Removing or moving old shared libraries is one drastic way to identify
applications that have been linked against those vintage releases.)
<p>Once you have installed the Berkeley DB libraries, unless they are installed
in a directory where the linker normally looks for shared libraries,
you will need to specify the installation directory as part of compiling
and linking against Berkeley DB.  Consult your system manuals or system
administrator for ways to specify a shared library directory when
compiling and linking applications with the Berkeley DB libraries.  Many
systems support environment variables (for example, LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
LD_RUN_PATH), or system configuration files (for example, /etc/ld.so.conf)
for this purpose.
<p><b>Warning</b>: some UNIX installations may have an already existing
<b>/usr/lib/libdb.so</b>, and this library may be an incompatible
version of Berkeley DB.
<p>We recommend that applications link against libdb.so (for example, using
-ldb).  Even though the linker uses the file named libdb.so, the
executable file for the application remembers the library's SONAME
(libdb-<b>major</b>.<b>minor</b>.so).  This has the effect of
marking the applications with the versions they need at link time.
Because applications locate their needed SONAMEs when they are executed,
all previously linked applications will continue to run using the
library they were linked with, even when a new version of Berkeley DB is
installed and the file <b>libdb.so</b> is replaced with a new
version.
<p>Applications that know they are using features specific to a particular
Berkeley DB release can be linked to that release.  For example, an application
wanting to link to Berkeley DB major release "3" can link using -ldb-3, and
applications that know about a particular minor release number can specify
both major and minor release numbers; for example, -ldb-3.5.
<p>If you want to link with Berkeley DB before performing library installation,
the "make" command will have created a shared library object in the
<b>.libs</b> subdirectory of the build directory, such as
<b>build_unix/.libs/libdb-major.minor.so</b>.  If you want to link a
file against this library, with, for example, a major number of "3" and
a minor number of "5", you should be able to do something like the
following:
<p><blockquote><pre>cc -L BUILD_DIRECTORY/.libs -o testprog testprog.o -ldb-3.5
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH="BUILD_DIRECTORY/.libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ./testprog</pre></blockquote>
<p>where <b>BUILD_DIRECTORY</b> is the full directory path to the directory
where you built Berkeley DB.
<p>The libtool program (which is configured in the build directory) can be
used to set the shared library path and run a program.  For example,
the following runs the gdb debugger on the db_dump utility after setting
the appropriate paths:
<p><blockquote><pre>libtool gdb db_dump</pre></blockquote>
<p>Libtool may not know what to do with arbitrary commands (it is hardwired
to recognize "gdb" and some other commands).  If it complains the mode
argument will usually resolve the problem:
<p><blockquote><pre>libtool --mode=execute my_debugger db_dump</pre></blockquote>
<p>On most systems, using libtool in this way is exactly equivalent to
setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable and then executing the
program.  On other systems, using libtool has the virtue of knowing about
any other details on systems that don't behave in this typical way.
