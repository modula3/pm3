<h1 align=center>Configuring locking: sizing the system</h1>
<p>The lock system is sized using the following three functions:
<p><blockquote><pre><a href="../../api_c/env_set_lk_max_locks.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_lk_max_locks</a>
<a href="../../api_c/env_set_lk_max_lockers.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_lk_max_lockers</a>
<a href="../../api_c/env_set_lk_max_objects.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_lk_max_objects</a></pre></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="../../api_c/env_set_lk_max_locks.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_lk_max_locks</a>, <a href="../../api_c/env_set_lk_max_lockers.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_lk_max_lockers</a>,
and <a href="../../api_c/env_set_lk_max_objects.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_lk_max_objects</a> methods specify the maximum number of
locks, lockers, and locked objects supported by the lock subsystem,
respectively.  The maximum number of locks is the number of locks that
can be simultaneously requested in the system.  The maximum number of
lockers is the number of lockers that can simultaneously request locks
in the system.  The maximum number of lock objects is the number of
objects that can simultaneously be locked in the system.  Selecting
appropriate values requires an understanding of your application and
its databases.  If the values are too small, requests for locks in an
application will fail.  If the values are too large, the locking
subsystem will consume more resources than is necessary.  It is better
to err in the direction of allocating too many locks, lockers, and
objects because increasing the number of locks does not require large
amounts of additional resources.
<p>The recommended algorithm for selecting the maximum number of locks,
lockers, and lock objects is to run the application under stressful
conditions and then review the lock system's statistics to determine
the maximum number of locks, lockers, and lock objects that were used.
Then, double these values for safety.  However, in some large
applications, finer granularity of control is necessary in order to
minimize the size of the Lock subsystem.
<p>The maximum number of lockers can be estimated as follows:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>If the database environment is configured to use transactions, the
maximum number of lockers needed is the number of simultaneously active
transactions and child transactions (where a child transaction is active
until its parent commits or aborts, not until it commits or aborts).
<li>If the database environment is not configured to use transactions, the
maximum number of lockers needed is the number of simultaneous
non-cursor operations plus an additional locker for every simultaneously
open cursor.
</ul>
<p>The maximum number of lock objects needed can be estimated as follows:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>For Btree and Recno access methods, you will need one lock object per
level of the database tree, at a minimum.  (Unless keys are quite large
with respect to the page size, neither Recno nor Btree database trees
should ever be deeper than five levels.)  Then, you will need one lock
object for each leaf page of the database tree that will be
simultaneously accessed.
<li>For the Queue access method, you will need one lock object per record
that is simultaneously accessed.  To this, add one lock object per page
that will be simultaneously accessed.  (Because the Queue access method
uses fixed-length records and the database page size is known, it is
possible to calculate the number of pages -- and, therefore, the lock
objects -- required.)  Deleted records skipped by a <a href="../../api_c/dbc_get.html#DB_NEXT">DB_NEXT</a> or
<a href="../../api_c/dbc_get.html#DB_PREV">DB_PREV</a> operation do not require a separate lock object.
Further, if your application is using transactions, no database
operation will ever use more than three lock objects at any time.
<li>For the Hash access method, you only need a single lock object.
</ul>
<p>For all access methods, you should then add an additional lock object
per database for the database's metadata page.
<p>The maximum number of locks required by an application cannot be easily
estimated.  It is possible to calculate a maximum number of locks by
multiplying the maximum number of lockers, times the maximum number of
lock objects, times two (two for the two possible lock modes for each
object, read and write).  However, this is a pessimal value, and real
applications are unlikely to actually need that many locks.  Reviewing
the Lock subsystem statistics is the best way to determine this value.
