<p><ol>
<p><li><b>My Win* C/C++ application crashes in the Berkeley DB library when Berkeley DB calls
fprintf (or some other standard C library function).</b>
<p>You should be using the "Debug Multithreaded DLL" compiler option in
your application when you link with the
build_win32/Debug/libdb41d.lib library (this .lib file
is actually a stub for libdb41d.DLL). To check this
setting in Visual C++, choose the <i>Project/Settings</i> menu
item and select <i>Code Generation</i> under the tab marked
<i>C/C++</i>; and see the box marked <i>Use runtime
library</i>.  This should be set to <i>Debug Multithreaded DLL</i>.
If your application is linked against the static library,
build_win32/Debug/libdb41sd.lib; then, you will want
to set <i>Use runtime library</i> to <i>Debug Multithreaded</i>.
<p>Setting this option incorrectly can cause multiple versions of the
standard libraries to be linked into your application (one on behalf
of your application, and one on behalf of the Berkeley DB library).  That
violates assumptions made by these libraries, and traps can result.
<p><li><b>Why are the build options for DB_DLL marked as "Use MFC in a Shared DLL"?
Does Berkeley DB use MFC?</b>
<p>Berkeley DB does not use MFC at all.  It does however, call malloc and free
and other facilities provided by the Microsoft C runtime library.  We
found in our work that many applications and libraries are built
assuming MFC, and specifying this for Berkeley DB solves various
interoperation issues, and guarantees that the right runtime libraries
are selected.  Note that because we do not use MFC facilities, the MFC
library DLL is not marked as a dependency for libdb.dll, but the
appropriate Microsoft C runtime is.
<p><li><b>The test suite hangs under Windows.</b>
<p>There are bugs in some versions of Tcl that may cause the test suite to
hang on Windows (specifically, we've seen hangs on Windows/NT 4.0). Tcl
version 8.4 (currently available as an alpha release) has fixed the
problem, or there are patches available for Tcl 8.3.2 (see bug #119188
in the Tcl SourceForge database). Note that if you want to run the test
suite against a Debug version of Berkeley DB, you need to build a Debug
version of Tcl. This involves building Tcl from its source.
