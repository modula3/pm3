<h1 align=center>Supporting utilities</h1>
<p>The following are the standalone utilities that provide supporting
functionality for the Berkeley DB environment:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a href="../../utility/berkeley_db_svc.html">berkeley_db_svc</a><dd>The <a href="../../utility/berkeley_db_svc.html">berkeley_db_svc</a> utility is the Berkeley DB RPC server that
provides standard server functionality for client applications.
<p><dt><a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a><dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> utility supports database backup and archival,
and log file administration.  It facilitates log reclamation and the
creation of database snapshots.  Generally, some form of log archival
must be done if a database environment has been configured for logging
or transactions.
<p><dt><a href="../../utility/db_checkpoint.html">db_checkpoint</a><dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_checkpoint.html">db_checkpoint</a> utility runs as a daemon process, monitoring
the database log and periodically issuing checkpoints.  It facilitates
log reclamation and the creation of database snapshots.  Generally, some
form of database checkpointing must be done if a database environment has
been configured for transactions.
<p><dt><a href="../../utility/db_deadlock.html">db_deadlock</a><dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_deadlock.html">db_deadlock</a> utility runs as a daemon process, periodically
traversing the database lock structures and aborting transactions when it
detects a deadlock.  Generally, some form of deadlock detection must be
done if a database environment has been configured for locking.
<p><dt><a href="../../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a><dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a> utility writes a copy of the database to a flat-text
file in a portable format.
<p><dt><a href="../../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a><dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> utility reads the flat-text file produced by
<a href="../../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a> and loads it into a database file.
<p><dt><a href="../../utility/db_printlog.html">db_printlog</a><dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_printlog.html">db_printlog</a> utility displays the contents of Berkeley DB log files
in a human-readable and parsable format.
<p><dt><a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a><dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility runs after an unexpected Berkeley DB or system
failure to restore the database to a consistent state.  Generally, some
form of database recovery must be done if databases are being modified.
<p><dt><a href="../../utility/db_stat.html">db_stat</a>  <dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_stat.html">db_stat</a> utility displays statistics for databases and database
environments.
<p><dt><a href="../../utility/db_upgrade.html">db_upgrade</a><dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_upgrade.html">db_upgrade</a> utility provides a command-line interface for
upgrading underlying database formats.
<p><dt><a href="../../utility/db_verify.html">db_verify</a><dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_verify.html">db_verify</a> utility provides a command-line interface for
verifying the database format.
</dl>
<p>All of the functionality implemented for these utilities is also available
as part of the standard Berkeley DB API.  This means that threaded applications
can easily create a thread that calls the same Berkeley DB functions as do the
utilities.  This often simplifies an application environment by removing
the necessity for multiple processes to negotiate database and database
environment creation and shut down.
