<h1 align=center>Opening multiple databases in a single file</h1>
<p>Applications may create multiple databases within a single physical
file.  This is useful when the databases are both numerous and
reasonably small, in order to avoid creating a large number of
underlying files, or when it is desirable to include secondary index
databases in the same file as the primary index database.  Multiple
databases are an administrative convenience and using them is unlikely
to effect database performance.  To open or create a file that will
include more than a single database, specify a database name when
calling the <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a> method.
<p>Physical files do not need to be comprised of a single type of database,
and databases in a file may be of any mixture of types, except for Queue
databases.  Queue databases must be created one per file and cannot
share a file with any other database type.  There is no limit on the
number of databases that may be created in a single file other than the
standard Berkeley DB file size and disk space limitations.
<p>It is an error to attempt to open a second database in a file that was
not initially created using a database name, that is, the file must
initially be specified as capable of containing multiple databases for a
second database to be created in it.
<p>It is not an error to open a file that contains multiple databases without
specifying a database name, however the database type should be specified
as DB_UNKNOWN and the database must be opened read-only.  The handle that
is returned from such a call is a handle on a database whose key values
are the names of the databases stored in the database file and whose data
values are opaque objects.  No keys or data values may be modified or
stored using this database handle.
<p>Storing multiple databases in a single file is identical to storing each
database in a separate file with the exception of some configuration
information and the likely need for locking and a shared underlying
memory pool.
<p>There are four types of configuration information which must be specified
consistently for all databases in a file, rather than differing on a
per-database basis.  They are: byte order, checksum and encryption
behavior, and page size.  When creating additional databases in a file,
any of these configuration values specified must be consistent with the
existing databases in the file or an error will be returned.
<p>
An additional difference is how locking and the underlying memory pool
services must to be configured.  As an example, consider two databases
instantiated in two different physical files.  If access to each
separate database is single-threaded, there is no reason to perform any
locking of any kind, and the two databases may be read and written
simultaneously.  Further, there would be no requirement to create a
shared database environment in which to open the databases.
<p>Because multiple databases in a file exist in a single physical file,
opening two databases in the same file requires locking be enabled
(unless access to the databases is known to be single-threaded, that
is, only one of the databases is ever read or written at a time).
As the locks for the two databases can only conflict during page
allocation, this additional locking is unlikely to effect performance.
<p>Also, because multiple databases in a file exist in a single physical
file, opening two databases in the same file requires the databases
share an underlying memory pool so that per-physical-file information
common between the two databases is updated correctly.
<p>In summary, applications opening multiple databases in a single file,
will almost certainly need to create a shared database environment.
