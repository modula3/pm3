<h1 align=center>Common errors</h1>
<p>This page outlines some of the most common problems that people encounter
and some suggested courses of action.
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd>Core dumps or garbage returns from random Berkeley DB operations.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>Failure to zero out DBT structure before issuing request.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>Before using a <a href="../../api_c/dbt_class.html">DBT</a>, you must initialize all its elements
to 0 and then set the ones you are using explicitly.
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd>Random crashes and/or database corruption.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>Running multiple threads, but did not specify <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_THREAD">DB_THREAD</a>
to <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a> or <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a>.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>Any time you are sharing a handle across multiple threads, you must
specify <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_THREAD">DB_THREAD</a> when you open that handle.
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd><a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> returns EINVAL.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>The environment home directory is a remote mounted filesystem.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>Use a locally mounted filesystem instead.
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd><a href="../../api_c/db_get.html">DB-&gt;get</a> calls are returning EINVAL.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>The application is running with threads, but did not specify the
<a href="../../api_c/dbt_class.html#DB_DBT_MALLOC">DB_DBT_MALLOC</a>, <a href="../../api_c/dbt_class.html#DB_DBT_REALLOC">DB_DBT_REALLOC</a> or <a href="../../api_c/dbt_class.html#DB_DBT_USERMEM">DB_DBT_USERMEM</a>
flags in the <a href="../../api_c/dbt_class.html">DBT</a> structures used in the call.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>When running with threaded handles (that is, specifying <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_THREAD">DB_THREAD</a>
to <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> or <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a>), you must specify one of those
flags for all <a href="../../api_c/dbt_class.html">DBT</a> structures in which Berkeley DB is returning data.
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd>Running multiple threads or processes, and the database appears to be
getting corrupted.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>Locking is not enabled.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>Make sure that you are acquiring locks in your access methods.  You
must specify <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_LOCK">DB_INIT_LOCK</a> to your <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> call and then
pass that environment to <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a>.
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd>Locks are accumulating, or threads and/or processes are deadlocking,
even though there is no concurrent access to the database.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>Failure to close a cursor.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>Cursors retain locks between calls.  Everywhere the application uses
a cursor, the cursor should be explicitly closed as soon as possible after
it is used.
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd>The system locks up.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>Application not checking for <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>Unless you are using the Concurrent Data Store product, whenever you
have multiple threads and/or processes and at least one of them is
writing, you have the potential for deadlock.  As a result, you must
test for the <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a> return on every Berkeley DB call.  In
general, updates should take place in a transaction, or you might leave
the database in an inconsistent state.  Reads may take place outside
the context of a transaction under common conditions.
<p>Whenever you get a <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a> return, you should do the
following:
<p><ol>
<p><li>If you are running in a transaction, abort the transaction after first
closing any cursors opened in the transaction.
<p><li>If you are not running in a transaction, simply close the cursor that got
the <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a> (if it was a cursor operation), and retry.
</ol>
<p>See <a href="../../ref/transapp/put.html">Recoverability and deadlock
avoidance</a> for further information.
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd>An inordinately high number of deadlocks.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>Read-Modify-Write pattern without using the RMW flag.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>If you frequently read a piece of data, modify it and then write
it, you may be inadvertently causing a large number of deadlocks.  Try
specifying the <a href="../../api_c/dbc_get.html#DB_RMW">DB_RMW</a> flag on your get calls.
<p>Or, if the application is doing a large number of updates in a small
database, turning off Btree splits may help (see <a href="../../api_c/db_set_flags.html#DB_REVSPLITOFF">DB_REVSPLITOFF</a>
for more information.)
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd>I run recovery and it exits cleanly, but my database changes are missing.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>Failure to enable logging and transactions in the database environment;
failure to specify <a href="../../api_c/env_class.html">DB_ENV</a> handle when creating <a href="../../api_c/db_class.html">DB</a> handle;
transaction handle not passed to Berkeley DB interface; failure to commit the
transaction.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>Make sure that the environment and database handles are properly
created, that the application passes the transaction handle returned by
<a href="../../api_c/txn_begin.html">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_begin</a> to the appropriate Berkeley DB interfaces, and that each
transaction is eventually committed.
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd>Recovery fails.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>A database was updated in a transactional environment, both with and
without transactional handles.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>If any database write operation is done using a transaction handle,
every write operation must be done in the context of a transaction.
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd>A database environment locks up, sometimes gradually.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>A thread of control exited unexpectedly, holding Berkeley DB resources.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>Whenever a thread of control exits holding Berkeley DB resources, all threads
of control must exit the database environment, and recovery must be run.
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd>A database environment locks up, sometimes gradually.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>Cursors are not being closed before transaction abort.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>Before an application aborts a transaction, any cursors opened within
the context of that transaction must be closed.
<p><dt><b>Symptom:</b><dd>Transaction abort or recovery fail, or database corruption occurs.
<p><dt>Possible Cause:<dd>Log files were removed before it was safe.
<p><dt>Fix:<dd>Do not remove any log files from a database environment until Berkeley DB
declares it safe.
