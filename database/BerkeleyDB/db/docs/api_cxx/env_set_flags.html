<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The <b>flags</b> value must be set to 0 or by bitwise inclusively <b>OR</b>'ing together one or
more of the following values:
If <b>onoff</b> is
zero,
the specified flags are cleared;  otherwise they are set.
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="DB_AUTO_COMMIT">DB_AUTO_COMMIT</a><dd>If set, operations for which no explicit transaction handle was
specified, and which modify databases in the database environment, will
be automatically enclosed within a transaction.  If the call succeeds,
changes made by the operation will be recoverable.  If the call fails,
the operation will have made no changes.
<p>Calling DbEnv::set_flags with the <a href="../api_cxx/env_set_flags.html#DB_AUTO_COMMIT">DB_AUTO_COMMIT</a> flag only affects
the specified <a href="../api_cxx/env_class.html">DbEnv</a> handle (and any other Berkeley DB handles opened
within the scope of that handle).
For consistent behavior across the environment, all <a href="../api_cxx/env_class.html">DbEnv</a>
handles opened in the environment must either set the <a href="../api_cxx/env_set_flags.html#DB_AUTO_COMMIT">DB_AUTO_COMMIT</a> flag
or the flag should be specified in the <b>DB_CONFIG</b> configuration
file.
<p>The <a href="../api_cxx/env_set_flags.html#DB_AUTO_COMMIT">DB_AUTO_COMMIT</a> flag may be used to configure Berkeley DB at any time during

overwrites files using alternating 0xff, 0x00 and 0xff byte patterns.

<p>Calling DbEnv::set_flags with the DB_PANIC_ENVIRONMENT flag affects the
database environment, including all threads of control accessing the

<p><dt><a name="DB_REGION_INIT">DB_REGION_INIT</a><dd>In some applications, the expense of page-faulting the underlying shared
memory regions can affect performance.  (For example, if the page-fault
occurs while holding a lock, other lock requests can convoy, and overall
throughput may decrease.)  If set, Berkeley DB will page-fault shared regions
into memory when initially creating or joining a Berkeley DB environment.  In
addition, Berkeley DB will write the shared regions when creating an
environment, forcing the underlying virtual memory and filesystems to
instantiate both the necessary memory and the necessary disk space.
This can also avoid out-of-disk space failures later on.
<p>Calling DbEnv::set_flags with the DB_REGION_INIT flag only affects
the specified <a href="../api_cxx/env_class.html">DbEnv</a> handle (and any other Berkeley DB handles opened

This means that transactions exhibit the ACI (atomicity, consistency,
and isolation) properties, but not D (durability); that is, database
integrity will be maintained, but if the application or system fails,
it is possible some number of the most recently committed transactions
may be undone during recovery.  The number of transactions at risk is
governed by how many log updates can fit into the log buffer, how often
the operating system flushes dirty buffers to disk, and how often the
log is checkpointed

</dl>
<p>The DbEnv::set_flags method either returns a non-zero error value or throws an exception that
encapsulates a non-zero error value on failure, and returns 0 on success.
<p>The database environment's flag values may also be set using the environment's
<b>DB_CONFIG</b> file.  The syntax of the entry in that file is a
single line with the string "set_flags", one or more whitespace characters,
and the interface flag argument as a string; for example, "set_flags
DB_TXN_NOSYNC".  Because the <b>DB_CONFIG</b> file is read when the database
environment is opened, it will silently overrule configuration done
before that time.
<h1>Errors</h1>
<p>The DbEnv::set_flags method may fail and throw an exception or return a non-zero error for the following conditions:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
</dl>
<p>The DbEnv::set_flags method may fail and throw an exception or return a non-zero error for errors specified for other Berkeley DB and C library or system methods.
If a catastrophic error has occurred, the DbEnv::set_flags method may fail and
either return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a> or throw a
<a href="../api_cxx/runrec_class.html">DbRunRecoveryException</a>,
in which case all subsequent Berkeley DB calls will fail in the same way.
