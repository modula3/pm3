<h3><pre>
#include &lt;db_cxx.h&gt;
<p>
int
Db::set_cachesize(u_int32_t gbytes, u_int32_t bytes, int ncache);
</pre></h3>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Set the size of the shared memory buffer pool -- that is, the cache --
to <b>gbytes</b> gigabytes plus <b>bytes</b>.  The cache should be
the size of the normal working data set of the application, with some
small amount of additional memory for unusual situations.  (Note: the
working set is not the same as the number of pages accessed
simultaneously, and should be quite a bit larger!)
<p>The default cache size is 256KB, and may not be specified as less than
20KB.  Any cache size less than 500MB is automatically increased by 25%
to account for buffer pool overhead; cache sizes larger than 500MB are
used as specified.  The current maximum size of a single cache is 4GB.
For information on tuning the Berkeley DB cache size, see
<a href="../ref/am_conf/cachesize.html">Selecting a cache size</a>.
<p>It is possible to specify caches to Berkeley DB that are large enough so that
they cannot be allocated contiguously on some architectures.  For
example, some releases of Solaris limit the amount of memory that may
be allocated contiguously by a process.  If <b>ncache</b> is 0 or 1,
the cache will be allocated contiguously in memory.  If it is greater
than 1, the cache will be broken up into <b>ncache</b> equally sized,
separate pieces of memory.
<p>Because databases opened within Berkeley DB environments use the cache
specified to the environment, it is an error to attempt to set a cache
in a database created within an environment.
<p>The Db::set_cachesize interface may not be called after the <a href="../api_cxx/db_open.html">Db::open</a>
interface is called.
<p>The Db::set_cachesize method either returns a non-zero error value or throws an exception that
encapsulates a non-zero error value on failure, and returns 0 on success.
<p>The database environment's cache size may also be set using the environment's
<b>DB_CONFIG</b> file.  The syntax of the entry in that file is a
single line with the string "set_cachesize", one or more whitespace characters,
and the three arguments specified to this interface, separated by whitespace
characters, for example, "set_cachesize 1 500 2".  Because the <b>DB_CONFIG</b> file is read when the database
environment is opened, it will silently overrule configuration done
before that time.
<h1>Errors</h1>
<p>The Db::set_cachesize method may fail and throw an exception or return a non-zero error for the following conditions:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
<p>The specified cache size was impossibly small.
<p>Called in a database environment.
<p>Called after
<a href="../api_cxx/db_open.html">Db::open</a>
was called.
</dl>
<p>The Db::set_cachesize method may fail and throw an exception or return a non-zero error for errors specified for other Berkeley DB and C library or system methods.
If a catastrophic error has occurred, the Db::set_cachesize method may fail and
either return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a> or throw a
<a href="../api_cxx/runrec_class.html">DbRunRecoveryException</a>,
in which case all subsequent Berkeley DB calls will fail in the same way.
