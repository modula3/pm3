<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This manual page describes the specific details of the Dbt class,
used to encode keys and data items in a database.
<a name="3"><!--meow--></a>
<h3>Key/Data Pairs</h3>
<p>Storage and retrieval for the <a href="../api_java/db_class.html">Db</a> access methods are based on
key/data pairs.  Both key and data items are represented by Dbt
objects.  Key and data byte strings may refer to strings of zero length
up to strings of essentially unlimited length.  See
<a href="../ref/am_misc/dbsizes.html">Database limits</a> for more
information.
<p>The Dbt class provides simple access to an underlying data
structure, whose elements can be examined or changed using the
<b>set_</b> or <b>get_</b> methods.  The remainder of the manual
page sometimes refers to these accesses using the underlying name; for
example, <b>ulen</b> rather than Dbt.get_ulen and
Dbt.set_ulen.  Dbt can be subclassed, providing a way
to associate with it additional data or references to other
structures.
<p>The constructors set all elements of the underlying structure to zero.
The constructor with one argument has the effect of setting all elements
to zero except for the <b>data</b> and <b>size</b> elements.  The
constructor with three arguments has the effect of setting all elements
to zero except for the <b>data</b>, <b>size</b> and <b>offset</b>
elements.
<p>In the case where the <b>flags</b> structure element is set to 0, when
being provided a key or data item by the application, the Berkeley DB package
expects the <b>data</b> object to be set to a byte array of
<b>size</b> bytes.  When returning a key/data item to the application,
the Berkeley DB package will store into the <b>data</b> object a byte array
of <b>size</b> bytes.  During a get operation, if none of the
Db.DB_DBT_MALLOC, Db.DB_DBT_REALLOC or Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM
flags are specified, the operation occurs as if Db.DB_DBT_MALLOC
was used.
<p>Access to Dbt objects is not re-entrant.  In particular, if
multiple threads simultaneously access the same Dbt object using
<a href="../api_java/db_class.html">Db</a> API calls, the results are undefined, and may result in a
crash.  One easy way to avoid problems is to use Dbt objects
that are
created as local variables and not shared among threads.
<p>The elements of the structure underlying the Dbt class are defined as follows:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>byte[] <a name="data">data</a>;<dd>A byte array containing the data.
This element is accessed using Dbt.get_data and
Dbt.set_data, and may be initialized using one
of the constructors.
Note that the array data is not copied immediately, but only when the
Dbt is used.
<p>The Java API also provides helper methods Dbt.get_object and
Dbt.set_object to encode and decode objects using the Java
serialization API.  These methods use <i>ObjectInputStream</i> and
<i>ObjectOutputStream</i> internally to manipulate an array of bytes
representing an object (and any connected objects).  All of the rules of Java
Serialization apply.  In particular, the object(s) must implement either the
<i>Serializable</i> or <i>Externalizable</i> interface.  Note that the
serialized encoding trades efficiency for convenience.
<p><dt>int recno_key_data;<dd>The data representing a key used with a Recno database.  Recno database
records are ordered by integer keys starting at 1.  When the
Dbt.set_recno_key_data method is called, the data, size and offset
fields in the Dbt are implicitly set to hold a byte array representation
of the integer key.
<p><dt>int offset;<dd>The number of bytes offset into the <b>data</b> array to determine the
portion of the array actually used.  This element is accessed using
Dbt.get_offset and Dbt.set_offset.  Although Java
normally maintains proper alignment of byte arrays, the set_offset
method can be used to specify unaligned addresses.  Unaligned address
accesses that are not supported by the underlying hardware may be
reported as an exception, or may stop the running Java program.
<p><dt>int size;<dd>The length of <b>data</b>, in bytes.
This element is accessed using Dbt.get_size and
Dbt.set_size, and may be initialized
implicitly to the length of the data array with the constructor having
one argument.
<p><dt>int ulen;<dd>The size of the user's buffer (referred to by <b>data</b>), in bytes.
This location is not written by the <a href="../api_java/db_class.html">Db</a> methods.
<p>Note that applications can determine the length of a record by setting
the <b>ulen</b> to 0 and checking the return value found in <b>size</b>.
See the Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM flag for more information.
<p>This element is accessed using
Dbt.get_ulen and Dbt.set_ulen.
<p><dt>int dlen;<dd>The length of the partial record being read or written by the application,
in bytes.
See the Db.DB_DBT_PARTIAL flag for more information.
This element is accessed using
Dbt.get_dlen, and Dbt.set_dlen.
<p><dt>int doff;<dd>The offset of the partial record being read or written by the application,
in bytes.
See the Db.DB_DBT_PARTIAL flag for more information.
This element is accessed using
Dbt.get_doff and Dbt.set_doff.
<p><dt>int flags;<dd>This element is accessed using Dbt.get_flags and
Dbt.set_flags.
<p>The <b>flags</b> value must be set by bitwise inclusively <b>OR</b>'ing together one or more of
the following values:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_DBT_MALLOC">Db.DB_DBT_MALLOC</a><dd>When this flag is set, Berkeley DB will allocate memory for the returned key
or data item
and return a byte array containing the data in the <b>data</b> field of
the key or data Dbt object.
<p>If Db.DB_DBT_MALLOC is specified, Berkeley DB allocates a properly sized
byte array to contain the data.  This can be convenient if you know little
about the nature of the data, specifically the size of data in the
database.  However, if your application makes repeated calls to retrieve
keys or data, you may notice increased garbage collection due to this
allocation.  If you know the maximum size of data you are retrieving, you
might decrease the memory burden and speed your application by allocating
your own byte array and using Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM.  Even if you don't
know the maximum size, you can use this option and reallocate your array
whenever your retrieval API call
throws a <a href="../api_java/memp_class.html">DbMemoryException</a>.
<p>It is an error to specify more than one of Db.DB_DBT_MALLOC,
Db.DB_DBT_REALLOC, and Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_DBT_REALLOC">Db.DB_DBT_REALLOC</a><dd>When this flag is set Berkeley DB
will return the data in the <b>data</b> field of the key or data
Dbt object, reusing the existing byte array if it is large
enough, or allocating a new one of the appropriate size.
<p>It is an error to specify more than one of Db.DB_DBT_MALLOC,
Db.DB_DBT_REALLOC, and Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM">Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM</a><dd>The <b>data</b> field of the key or data object must refer to memory
that is at least <b>ulen</b> bytes in length.  If the length of the
requested item is less than or equal to that number of bytes, the item
is copied into the memory referred to by the <b>data</b> field.
Otherwise, the <b>size</b> field is set to the length needed for the
requested item, and the error ENOMEM is returned.
<p>If Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM is specified, the data field of the Dbt
must be set to an appropriately sized byte array.
<p>It is an error to specify more than one of Db.DB_DBT_MALLOC,
Db.DB_DBT_REALLOC, and Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM.

<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_DBT_PARTIAL">Db.DB_DBT_PARTIAL</a><dd>Do partial retrieval or storage of an item.  If the calling application
is doing a get, the <b>dlen</b> bytes starting <b>doff</b> bytes from
the beginning of the retrieved data record are returned as if they
comprised the entire record.  If any or all of the specified bytes do
not exist in the record, the get is successful, and any existing bytes
are returned.
<p>For example, if the data portion of a retrieved record was 100 bytes,
and a partial retrieval was done using a Dbt having a <b>dlen</b>
field of 20 and a <b>doff</b> field of 85, the get call would succeed,
the <b>data</b> field would refer to the last 15 bytes of the record,
and the <b>size</b> field would be set to 15.
<p>If the calling application is doing a put, the <b>dlen</b> bytes starting
<b>doff</b> bytes from the beginning of the specified key's data record
are replaced by the data specified by the <b>data</b> and <b>size</b>
objects.
If <b>dlen</b> is smaller than <b>size</b>, the record will grow; if
<b>dlen</b> is larger than <b>size</b>, the record will shrink.
If the specified bytes do not exist, the record will be extended using nul
bytes as necessary, and the put call will succeed.
<p>It is an error to attempt a partial put using the <a href="../api_java/db_put.html">Db.put</a>
method in a database that supports duplicate records.
Partial puts in databases supporting duplicate records must be done
using a <a href="../api_java/dbc_class.html">Dbc</a> method.
<p>It is an error to attempt a partial put with differing <b>dlen</b> and
<b>size</b> values in Queue or Recno databases with fixed-length records.
<p>For example, if the data portion of a retrieved record was 100 bytes,
and a partial put was done using a Dbt having a <b>dlen</b>
field of 20, a <b>doff</b> field of 85, and a <b>size</b> field of 30,
the resulting record would be 115 bytes in length, where the last 30
bytes would be those specified by the put call.
