GRAS uses the daVinci graph visualization software to graphically
display the contents of GRAS3 schemata and pools. daVinci is available
in binary format from http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~davinci. 
The current release, or better the release GRAS3 uses, is V2.1.

This directory contains a rudimentary Modula-3 interface to daVincis
API. It provides starting a daVinci process, sending and receiving
messages to/from a daVinci process and also the first wrappers to hide
daVincis API syntax. Currently, this is included into the directories
PoolView and SchemeView. You can make this interface a library on its
own by simply adding a 'Library("DaVinci")' line to the m3makefile
(and change the makefiles for in SchemeView and PoolView
accordingly). 

If you want to implement more of daVincis API in this library feel
encouraged to do so. It would be great however, if you could send me
these changes, because we will also incorporate more of daVincis
functionality here in the future.

For comments, suggestions, questions about this interface contact

For anything concerning daVinci, you should rather contact the daVinci
developers (see URL above).
