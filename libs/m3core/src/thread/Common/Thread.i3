   newly-allocated "Mutex" is unlocked; a newly-allocated "Condition"
   is empty.  It is a checked runtime error to pass the "NIL" "Mutex",

PROCEDURE Join(t: T): REFANY;
(* Wait until "t" has terminated and return its result. It is a
   checked runtime error to call this more than once for any "t". *)

PROCEDURE Wait(m: Mutex; c: Condition);
(* The calling thread must have "m" locked. Atomically unlocks "m" and
   waits on "c".  Then relocks "m" and returns. *)

   the call or sometime during the wait, raise "Alerted". *)

(* \paragraph*{Specifying thread stack size.} Normally "Fork" uses a
   default value for the size of the stack of the new thread.  It is
   possible to change the default value, and also to specify the value
   used for a particular call to "Fork" by supplying a "SizedClosure"
   rather than a "Closure".  Stack sizes are given as a number of
   "Word.T"s.
