(*--------------------------------------------- garbage collector support ---*)

PROCEDURE SuspendOthers ();
(* Suspend all threads except the caller's.  NOTE: Once the other threads
   are suspended, the remaining thread cannot use any of the synchronization
   operations (Signal, Wait, Broadcast, Pause).  Otherwise, it may deadlock
   with one of the suspended threads (by trying to acquire the internal
   lock "cm"). *)

PROCEDURE ResumeOthers ();
(* Resume the threads suspended by "SuspendOthers" *)

PROCEDURE ProcessStacks (p: PROCEDURE (start, stop: ADDRESS));
(* Apply p to each thread stack, with [start..stop] being the limits
   of the stack.  All other threads must be suspended.  ProcessStacks
   exists solely for the garbage collector.  *)

(* Feature:  Windows threads not created by Thread.Fork are not suspended
    or resumed, and their stacks are not processed. *)

   This procedure is a no-op on Windows/NT. *)
