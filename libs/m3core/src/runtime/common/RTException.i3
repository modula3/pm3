(* Implementation notes:

Safety:
   The "arg" and "aux_info" fields of a "RaiseActivation" are
   gigantic loopholes.  They may contain traced references or
   any other data.  As long as the activation stays on the stack,
   the collector will handle the traced references properly.
   Code that copies the activation data off the stack is
   <EM>very</EM> dangerous.

Unhandled Exceptions:

   When an exception is raised but not handled, the current
   backstop handler is invoked, "h(a,r)".  The current activation
   information is in "a" and the flag "r" indicating whether the failure
   was due to a restrictive "RAISES" clause. 

   There is only one backstop handler per process.

   The default backstop handler (represented by "NIL") converts the
   failing exception to

|      RuntimeError.E(RuntimeError.T.UnhandledException)  "or"
|      RuntimeError.E(RuntimeError.T.BlockedException)

   If the unhandled exception is one of these, the program is terminated
   with a diagnostic message.

   The default backstop preserves the module, line number, and pc
   information in the activation.  It sets "aux_info[0]" to the exception
   that was not handled and sets "aux_info[1]" to the argument passed to
   that exception.
