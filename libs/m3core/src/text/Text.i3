(*
   The characters of a text may be "CHAR"s or "WIDECHAR"s.  A single
   text may contain both "CHAR"s and "WIDECHAR"s.  The characters of
   a text are converted between the types "CHAR" and "WIDECHAR" as
   needed.  Hence, client code may deal exclusively with either "CHAR"s
   or "WIDECHAR"s, or it may handle both character types.

   A "CHAR" is converted to a "WIDECHAR" by zero-extending its ordinal
   value.  For example, if "c" is a "CHAR", "VAL (ORD (c), WIDECHAR)"
   is the corresponding "WIDECHAR".

   A "WIDECHAR" is converted to a "CHAR" by dropping the high-order
   eight bits of the "WIDECHAR".  For example, if "c" is "WIDECHAR",
   "VAL (Word.And (c, 16_ff), CHAR)" is the corresponding "CHAR"
   value.
