<h1>m3na Background</h1>
This project started on December 13, 1995, when I began an ill-fated effort to fully reimplement W. Press et al "Numerical Recipes in C", 1992, using Modula-3.  After tackling about half the chapters, I posted the status and asked for participants.  Mike Coffin responded, and asked if the copyright issue was fully addressed.  Based on the book's own statements, I believed it was.  However, I contacted NR to be sure.
<p>
<a href="wpress.txt">W. Press's January 20, 1996 response</a> was a strongly worded request to abandon the project, except perhaps under conditions of "clean room" development.  While Press's legal position may be questionable, I was in no position (nor in the mood) for extended court battles.  Therefore I ended the initial project.
<p>
Since I had in fact analyzed and reengineered the routines, I was prepared to do clean room, but wasn't sure where to find an enthusiastic but uncontaminated developer.  After a flurry of email and newgroup postings, Mike Coffin recommended we start fresh and do a full numerical package from scratch.  That was the genesis of this m3na project.
<p>
We intend that the code be free from copyright conflicts with all other parties.  We are reviewing the literature, doing original analysis, and developing original code.  If you believe that copyright violations have arisen, please contact Harry George (hgeorge@eskimo.com) immediately.

If you would like to contribute time and energy, please read through the Project Context material, then contact Harry George.  If you would like to contribute code (in any language), you must provide the source or development context as well.  It must be public domain, or otherwise without copyright and other legal constraints.
