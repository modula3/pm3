   i.e., an $N$'th order ode, with $N$ boundary conditions, $N_a$ of which
   are at the first boundary and $N_b = N - N_a$ of which are at the second
   boundary.


   \STitle{Overview}
   
   This routine uses an algorithm based on a finite-difference/relaxation 
   approach.  The theory is of this approach is widely known;  in particular
   it is described by Press {\it et al.}$^{[1]}$.  (Note that this 
   implementation is not based on Press';  rather it was written from 
   scratch in order to take advantage of the features of a modern 
   language --- Modula-3 --- such as dynamic allocation of memory, 
   exceptions and procedure types/variables.)

   The emphasis of this release (version 1.0) is on {\it maintainability},
   i.e., ease of understanding, debugging and modification, rather than
   efficiency.  

   The essence of the finite-difference/relaxation technique is to reduce
   the solution of a boundary value problem to an exactly determined system 
   of simultaneous,
   linear, algebraic equations.  As one might expect, therefore, the
   ``rate determing step'' of the integration process is the solution of the
   system of algebraic equations.  With maintainability in mind, therefore,
   the implementation separates out this part of the integration process so
   that the user may try different routines.

   In contrast, Press {\it et al.\/} tightly integrate the solution of the
   algebraic system with the rest of the integration process making the
   algorithm rather complicated and difficult to understand and maintain;  
   that said their algorithm is very efficient --- advantage is taken on the 
   block-diagonal structure of the system.  (Of course users can supply
   such a routine.)

   Two routines for solving the linear system are supplied with this module;
   neither takes advantage of the block-diagonal nature of the system.  
   However, the numerical integration of an ode, even in this slightly 
   inefficient way takes only seconds on a standard U{\sc nix} box 
   or 586\thinspace PC.

   In the following the details of the theory of the method are outlined.
   It is not necessary to study these, but some understanding may well
   be useful --- e.g., if an integration fails to converge.


   \STitle{Notation}
   
   The following notation is used:
   \BUL{
       we have an $N$th order ode, represented as $N$ first order odes, and
       therefore a vector, $\y_k$, of these variables:
     }
   \BUL{
       $$\eqalign{
           \y_k = (y^{[0]}_k, y^{[1]}_k, \ldots, y^{[N-1]}_k)
         }$$
       where $y^{[n]}_k$ is the $n$'th derivative of $y$ at the $k$'th 
       grid-point.
     }
   \BUL{
       There are $K$ grid-points, $x_k$, $k = 1, \ldots, K$.
       (There are therefore $K-1$ intervals.)  
     }
   \BUL{
       We associate `a' and `A' with the first boundary, and `b' and `B' with 
       the second;  hence $x_1 = x_a$ and $x_K = x_b$.
     }


   \STitle{Defining the Problem}
   
   We represent an $N$th order ode as a system of $N$ first order odes.
   Therefore, the equations to be solved, together with their boundary 
   conditions are, in vector/matrix notation :
   $$\eqalignno{
       &{\d\y \over {\d x}} - \f(x,y,y^{[1]},\ldots,y^{[N-1]}) = E_k = 0, 
           \qquad k = 2\ldots K &(1)\cr
       &\A(x_1,\y_1) = \E_a = E_1 = 0, &(2)\cr
       &\B(x_k, \y_k) = \E_b = E_{K+1} = 0, &(3)\cr
     }$$  


   \STitle{The Finite-Difference Approximation Used}
   
   Choose a simple two-point finite-difference scheme;  then (1) becomes
   $$ 0 = \E_k = \y_k - \y_{k-1}  
               - (x_k - x_{k-1})\f_k(x_k,x_{k-1},\y_k,\y_{k-1}), \qquad
      k = 2, \ldots, K.
     \eqno{(4)}$$
   This approximation will be a good one provided $\Delta x$ is ``small''
   and the solution to our equation is ``well behaved''.

   The vector/matrix equation (4), together with finite-difference 
   approximations to (2) and (3) are an $NK \times NK$ system
   of linear equations, i.e, we have $NK$ equations for the $N$ unknowns,
   $y^{[n]}$ at the $K$ positions, $x_k$.


   \STitle{The Fundamental Idea}
   
   How does this help us find the solution?  Given an initial guess we can
   ``relax'' towards a better approximation by determining corrections to 
   $\y$ such that $\y + \Delta\y$ is a better approximation to the solution.


   \STitle{Relaxation}
   
   Expanding the \fdes, (4), in a Taylor series about $\y$, we have
   $$\halign to\displaywidth{%
         \tabskip=\centering%
         #&\tabskip=\centering#\tabskip=0pt\cr
         %
         $E_{nk}(\y_k + \Delta\y_k,\y_{k-1}+\Delta\y_{k-1}; 
                 x_k, x_{k-1})$\hfil&\cr 
         \noalign{\smallskip}
         $\qquad= E_{n,k}(x_k,\y_k; x_k, x_{k-1}) 
          + \displaystyle{\sum^N_{n=1}{      {\partial E_{n,k}} 
                                       \over {\partial y_{n,k-1}}}
                        \Delta y_{n,k-1}   
          + \sum^N_{n=1}{{\partial E_{n,k}} \over {\partial y_{n,k}}}
                        \Delta y_{n,k},}$\hfil&\hfil{\rm(5)}\cr
         \noalign{\smallskip}
         \hfil$n = 1,\ldots,N, \qquad k = 2,\ldots,K$&\cr
     }$$

   We want $\E(\y+\Delta\y)$ to be a better approximation than $\E(\y)$;
   assuming perfection then $\E(\y+\Delta\y) = 0$, so
   $$\eqalign{
        &\sum^N_{\hat n=1}{       {\partial E_{n,k}} 
                            \over {\partial y^{[\hat n]}(k-1)}}
                          \Delta y^{[\hat n]}(k-1)   
       + \sum^N_{\hat n=1}{       {\partial E_{n,k}} 
                            \over {\partial y^{[\hat n]}(k)}}
                          \Delta y^{[\hat n]}(k)\cr
       &\qquad
       = - E_{n,k}(x_k,\y_k; x_k, x_{k-1}),    
       \qquad n = 1,\ldots,N
       \qquad k = 2,\ldots,K.
     }\eqno{(6)}$$
   Expanding the boundary conditions in a similar way we obtain
   $$\eqalignno{
     \sum^N_{\hat n=1}{      {\partial E_{n,k=a=1}} 
                       \over {\partial y^{[\hat n]}(k=a)}}
                 \Delta y^{[\hat n]}(k_a) &= - E_{n,a}, 
         \qquad n = 1,\ldots,N_a, &(7)\cr
     \sum^N_{\hat n=1}{      {\partial E_{n,k=b=K+1}} 
                       \over {\partial y^{[\hat n]}(k=b)}}
                 \Delta y^{[\hat n]}(k_b) &= - E_{n,b},
         \qquad n = 1,\ldots,N_b. &(8)\cr
     }$$


   \STitle{Usage}
   
   Given an initial guess $\y_k$, $k=1,\ldots,K$, i.e., $Y_{n,k}$, we need
   to solve the system (6), (7) and (8), which we write as 
   $$ E_{i,j}\Delta y_j = e_j, \eqno{(9)} $$
   i.e.,

   $$

                     \ldots &

   Given the solution, $\Delta\y$, to this system we compute the improved
   approximate solution to the system of odes $\y := \y + \Delta\y$, 
   and repeat the procedure until $\vert\Delta\y\vert$ becomes smaller than 
   some acceptable value.  

   
   \STitle{Algorithm to construct $\E$ and $\e$}

   The question remains, how does the algorithm know the values of the various
   partial derivatives and the \fdes\ themselves (at $k = 2,\ldots,K$) and also
   the boundary conditions (at $k = 1$ and $k = K+1$)?  These are supplied 
   through two user-implemented routines:

   It is convenient to introduce two matrices, $S$ and $F$;  these are 
   defined by
   $$\eqalign{
      &S_{n,\hat n}(k) = {      {\partial E_{n,k}} 
                          \over {\partial y^{[\hat n]}(k-1)}}, 
           \qquad
       S_{n,\hat n + N}(k) = {      {\partial E_{n,k}} 
                              \over {\partial y^{[\hat n]}(k)}}, 
           \qquad n = 1,\ldots,N, \qquad k = 2,\ldots,K\cr
           \noalign{\smallskip}
      &S_{n,\hat n} = {{\partial E_{n,1}} \over {\partial y_{\hat n,1}}}, 
           \qquad k = a = 1 \cr
           \noalign{\smallskip}
      &S_{n,\hat n} = {{\partial E_{n,K+1}} \over {\partial y_{\hat n,K}}}, 
           \qquad k = b = K+1 \cr
           \noalign{\smallskip}
      &F_n = A_n, \qquad k = a = 1, \qquad n = 0\ldots N_a - 1\cr
           \noalign{\smallskip}
      &F_n = B_n, \qquad k = b = K + 1, \qquad n = 0\ldots N - N_a - 1\cr
           \noalign{\smallskip}
      &F_n = E_n, \qquad n = 0\ldots N - 1.\cr
     }$$
   
   The tests which come with {\code BVP\char'137OrdN\char'137 FD} provide 
   examples.


   \STitle{What can go wrong}

   \BUL{The algorithm relies on initial guess.  Experience suggests that
        this need not be particularly close to the actual solution, but of
        course if convergence problems are found one should try to determine
        a better initial guess.
     }
   \BUL{Experience gained so far with this algorithm suggests that 
        oscillation of the maximum error (as displayed after each iteration)
        means the differential equation has not been coded correctly.}


   \STitle{Diagnostics --- {\code debug}}

   If ``debug'' is set equal to ``true'' then several debug files are
   written (<...>.dlog).  These should help to determine what went wrong.
   The files are:\bigskip
 
   \twocoltable{3truecm}{1truecm}{10truecm}{%
       ode-E.dlog     & contains $\E$ at each iteration;\cr
       ode-Y.dlog     & \dots $\Y$ \dots;\cr
       ode-corr.dlog  & \dots $\Delta\y$ \dots;\cr
       ode-e.dlog     & \dots $\e$ \dots;\cr
       ode-x.dlog     & \dots $\x$ \dots;\cr
       Lin\_Alg.dlog  & contains the linear system solved in the form of an
                        augmented matrix.
