Modula-3 invites you to structure your program as a set of modules
interconnected via interfaces.  Each interface typically corresponds
to an abstract data type.  Some of these abstractions are particular
to the program at hand, but others are more general. This manual
describes a collection of interfaces defining abstractions that SRC's
programmers have found useful over a number of years of experience
with Modula-3 and its precursors.
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>abstraction</SPAN></SPAN>
<P>
This manual concentrates on basic abstractions such as the standard
interfaces required or recommended by the Modula-3 language
definition, various data structures, portable operating-system
functions, and control of the Modula-3 runtime.  For building
distributed systems, see

<H2> Naming conventions for types. </H2>
<P>
We generally give the name <TT>T</TT> to the main type in an interface.  For
example, the main type in the <TT>Date</TT> interface is <TT>Date.T</TT>.

<P>
Most object types have a method that is responsible for initializing
the object.  By convention, this method is named <TT>init</TT>, and returns
the object after initializing it, so that the object can be
initialized and used in an expression at the same time: for example,
</P>

<PRE><TT>
VAR s := NEW(Sequence.T).init();
</TT></PRE>

<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>init method</SPAN>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.TEXT><TT>init</TT>method</SPAN>
</SPAN>
If there are several different ways to initialize the object, there
will be several methods.  The most basic will be named <TT>init</TT> and the
others will receive descriptive names.  For example, <TT>Sequence.T.init</TT>
initializes an empty sequence; <TT>Sequence.T.fromArray</TT> initializes a
sequence from an array.
<P>
Many of our types are ``abstract'' in the sense that they define the
methods of a type, but not their implementations.  Various subtypes of
the abstract type define different methods corresponding to different
instances of the abstract type.  For example, the type <TT>Rd.T</TT> is a
abstract reader (a stream of input characters).  Its subtype
<TT>FileRd.T</TT> is a reader whose source is a file; its subtype <TT>TextRd.T</TT>
is a reader whose source is a text string.
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>abstract type</SPAN>
</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>subtype</SPAN>
</SPAN>
<P>
If you allocate an object of an abstract type and attempt to use it,
you will almost certainly get a checked runtime error, since its
methods will be <TT>NIL</TT>.  Therefore, you must read the interfaces to
find out which types are abstract and which are concrete.  The typical
pattern is that an abstract type does not have an <TT>init</TT> method, but
each of its concrete instances does.  This allows different subtypes
to be initialized differently.  For example, <TT>FileRd.T</TT> has an <TT>init</TT>
method that takes a file; <TT>TextRd.T</TT> has an <TT>init</TT> method that takes a
text; and <TT>Rd.T</TT> has no <TT>init</TT> method at all.
<P>
For some abstract types we choose to honor one of its subtypes as a
``default implementation''.  For example, we provide a hash table
implementation as the default for the abstract type <TT>Table.T</TT>.  In
this case we vary the naming convention: instead of a separate
interface <TT>HashTable</TT> defining the concrete type <TT>HashTable.T</TT> as a
subtype of <TT>Table.T</TT>, we declare the default concrete type in the same
interface with the abstract type and give it the name <TT>Default</TT>.  Thus
<TT>Table.T</TT> and <TT>Table.Default</TT> are respectively the abstract table type
and its default implementation via hash tables.  If you want to
allocate a table you must allocate a <TT>Table.Default</TT>, not a <TT>Table.T</TT>.
On the other hand, if you are defining a procedure that requires a
table as a parameter, you probably want to declare the parameter as a
<TT>Table.T</TT>, not a <TT>Table.Default</TT>, to avoid excluding other table
implementations.

  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.TEXT><TT>Default</TT></SPAN>
</SPAN>
<P>
We use abstract types only when they seem advantageous.  Thus the type
<TT>Sequence.T</TT>, which represents an extensible sequence, could have been
an abstract type, since different implementations are easy to imagine.
But engineering considerations argue against multiple implementations,
so we declared <TT>Sequence.T</TT> as a concrete type.

<H2> Concurrency. </H2>
<P>
The specification of a Modula-3 interface must explain how to use the
interface in a multithreaded program.  When not otherwise specified,
each procedure or method is <EM>atomic</EM>: it transforms an initial
state to a final state with no intermediate states that can be
observed by other threads.

</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>monitored data structure</SPAN>
</SPAN>
<P>
Alternatively, a data structure (the state of an entire interface, or
of a particular instance of an object type) can be specified as <EM>
unmonitored</EM>, in which case the procedures and methods operating on it
are not necessarily atomic.  In this case it is the client's
responsibility to ensure that multiple threads are not accessing the
data structure at the same time---or more precisely, that this happens
only if all the concurrent accesses are read-only operations. Thus for
an unmonitored data structure, the specification must state which
procedures or methods are read-only.
<P>
If all operations are read-only, there is no difference between
monitored and unmonitored data structures.

<H2> Aliasing. </H2> 
<P>
The procedures and methods defined in this manual are not guaranteed
to work with aliased <TT>VAR</TT> parameters.

<H2> Exception parameters for abstract types. </H2>
<P>
It is often useful for an exception to include a parameter providing
debugging information of use to the programmer, especially when the
exception signals abstraction failure.  Different implementations of
an abstract type may wish to supply different debugging information.
By convention, we use the type <TT>AtomList.T</TT> for this purpose.  The
first element of the list is an error code; the specification of the
subsequent elements is deferred to the subtypes.  Portable modules
should treat the entire parameter as an opaque type.
<P>
An implementation module can minimize the probability of collision by
prefixing its module name to each atom that it includes in the list.

<H2> Standard generic instances. </H2>
<P>
Several of the interfaces in this manual are generic.  Unless
otherwise specified, standard instances of these interfaces are
provided for all meaningful combinations of the formal imports ranging
over <TT>Atom</TT>, <TT>Integer</TT>, <TT>Refany</TT>, and <TT>Text</TT>.
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>standard instances of generic interfaces</SPAN>
</SPAN>
<P>
For each interface that is likely to be used as a generic parameter,
we define procedures <TT>Equal</TT>, <TT>Compare</TT>, and <TT>Hash</TT>.
<P>
The procedure <TT>Equal</TT> must compute an equivalence relation on the
values of the type; for example, <TT>Text.Equal(t, s)</TT> tests whether <TT>t</TT>
and <TT>s</TT> represent the same string.  (This is different from <TT>t = s</TT>,
which tests whether <TT>t</TT> and <TT>s</TT> are the same reference.)
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>Equal procedure</SPAN>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.TEXT><TT>Equal</TT> procedure</SPAN>
</SPAN>
<P>
If there is a natural total order on a type, then we define a
<TT>Compare</TT> procedure to compute it, as follows:
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>Compare procedure</SPAN>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.TEXT><TT>Compare</TT> procedure</SPAN>
</SPAN>

<PRE><TT>
PROCEDURE Compare(x, y: X): [-1..1];
(* Return 
| -1 `if` x R y `and not` Equal(x, y)`,` 
|  0 `if` Equal(x, y)`, and`
|  1 `if` y R x `and not` Equal(x, y)`.` 
*)
</TT></PRE>
<P>
(Technically, <TT>Compare</TT> represents a total order on the equivalence
classes of the type with respect to <TT>Equal</TT>.)  If there is no natural
order, we define a <TT>Compare</TT> procedure that causes a checked runtime
error.  This allows you to instantiate generic routines that require
an order (such as sorting routines), but requires you to pass a
compare procedure as an explicit argument when calling the generic
routine.
<P>
The function <TT>Hash</TT> is a hash function mapping values of a type <TT>T</TT> to
values of type <TT>Word.T</TT>.  This means that (1) it is time-invariant,
(2) if <TT>t1</TT> and <TT>t2</TT> are values of type <TT>T</TT> such that <TT>Equal(t1, t2)</TT>,
then <TT>Hash(t1) = Hash(t2)</TT>, and (3) its range is distributed uniformly
throughout <TT>Word.T</TT>.

<P>
Note that it is not valid to use <TT>LOOPHOLE(r, INTEGER)</TT> as a hash
function for a reference <TT>r</TT>, since this is not time-invariant on
implementations that use copying garbage collectors.

<H2> Sets and relations. </H2>
<P>
The specifications in this manual are written informally but
precisely, using basic mathematical concepts.  For completeness, here
are definitions of these concepts.
<P>
A <EM>set</EM> is a collection of elements, without consideration of
ordering or duplication: two sets are equal if and only if they
contain the same elements.
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>set</SPAN>
</SPAN>
<P>
If <TT>X</TT> and <TT>Y</TT> are sets, a <EM>map</EM> <TT>m</TT> from <TT>X</TT> to <TT>Y</TT> uniquely
determines for each <TT>x</TT> in <TT>X</TT> an element <TT>y</TT> in <TT>Y</TT>; we write <TT>y =
m(x)</TT>.  We refer to the set <TT>X</TT> as the <EM>domain</EM> of <TT>m</TT>, or
<TT>dom(m)</TT> for short, and the set <TT>Y</TT> as the <EM>range</EM> of <TT>m</TT>.  A <EM>
partial</EM> map from <TT>X</TT> to <TT>Y</TT> is a map from some subset of <TT>X</TT> to <TT>Y</TT>.

If <TT>X</TT> is a set, a <EM>relation</EM> <TT>R</TT> on <TT>X</TT> is a set of ordered pairs
<TT>(x, y)</TT> with <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> elements of <TT>X</TT>.  We write <TT>x R y</TT> if
<TT>(x, y)</TT> is an element of <TT>R</TT>.
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>relation</SPAN>
</SPAN>
<P>
A relation <TT>R</TT> on <TT>X</TT> is <EM>reflexive</EM> if <TT>x R x</TT> for every <TT>x</TT> in
<TT>X</TT>; it is <EM>symmetric</EM> if <TT>x R y</TT> implies that <TT>y R x</TT> for every

<TT>x R z</TT> for every <TT>x</TT>, <TT>y</TT>, <TT>z</TT> in <TT>X</TT>; and it is an <EM>equivalence

If <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> are elements of a set <TT>X</TT> that is totally ordered by a
relation <TT>R</TT>, we define the <EM>interval</EM> <TT>[x..y]</TT> as the set of all
<TT>z</TT> in <TT>X</TT> such that <TT>x R z</TT> and <TT>z R y</TT>.  Note that the notation
doesn't mention <TT>R</TT>, which is usually clear from the context (e.g.,
lower or equal for numbers).  We say <TT>[x..y]</TT> is <EM>closed</EM> at its upper and
lower endpoints because it includes <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT>.  Half-open and open
intervals exclude one or both endpoints; notationally we substitute a
parenthesis for the corresponding bracket, for example <TT>[x..y)</TT> or
<TT>(x..y)</TT>.
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>interval</SPAN>
</SPAN>
<P>
A <EM>sequence</EM> <TT>s</TT> is a map whose domain is a set of consecutive
integers.  In other words, if <TT>dom(s)</TT> is not empty, there are
integers <TT>l</TT> and <TT>u</TT>, with <TT>l&lt;=u</TT>, such that <TT>dom(s)</TT> is <TT>[l..u]</TT>.  We
often write <TT>s[i]</TT> instead of <TT>s(i)</TT>, to emphasize the similarity to a
Modula-3 array.  If the range of <TT>s</TT> is <TT>Y</TT>, we refer to <TT>s</TT> as a
sequence of <TT>Y</TT>'s.  The <EM>length</EM> of a sequence <TT>s</TT>, or <TT>len(s)</TT>,
is the number of elements in <TT>dom(s)</TT>.
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>sequence</SPAN>
</SPAN>
<P>
In the specifications, we often speak of assigning to an element of a
sequence or map, which is really a shorthand for replacing the
sequence or map with a suitable new one.  That is, assigning <TT>m(i) :=
x</TT> is like assigning <TT>m := m'</TT>, where <TT>dom(m')</TT> is the union of
<TT>dom(m)</TT> and <TT>{i}</TT>, where <TT>m'(i) = x</TT>, and where <TT>m'(j) = m(j)</TT> for
all <TT>j</TT> different from <TT>i</TT> and in <TT>dom(m)</TT>.
<P>
If <TT>s</TT> is a finite sequence, and <TT>R</TT> is a total order on the range of
<TT>s</TT>, then <EM>sorting</EM> <TT>s</TT> means to reorder its elements so that for
every pair of indexes <TT>i</TT> and <TT>j</TT> in <TT>dom(s)</TT>, <TT>s[i] R s[j]</TT> whenever
<TT>i &lt;= j</TT>.  We say that a particular sorting algorithm is <EM>stable</EM>
if it preserves the original order of elements that are equivalent
under <TT>R</TT>.
