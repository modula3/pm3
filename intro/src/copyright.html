<P>The Modula-3 release of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal (PM3) contains
numerous packages from several sources, all freely redistributable. 
Each package describes its detailed licensing terms. Our interpretation
of these terms, without any specific legal value, is exposed below.

<P>
The bulk of the distribution originates from DEC SRC and allows
free modification and redistribution, provided that you do not
hold DEC liable for anything related to SRC Modula-3 and that
you pay any fee incurred because of claims of damage arising
from your possession or use or inability to use the software.
By passing along this copyright with any redistribution, you prevent the
situation where someone else would sue DEC and you would be required to
indemnify DEC for such action.

<P>
A few packages or portions of packages are copyrighted by other industrial
research laboratories from Olivetti (m3tk), Xerox (regex), 
and Sun Microsystems (m3tk). They may be freely modified and redistributed
provided that the copyright notice is preserved and that you do not assume
any liability on their part.

<P>
A few programs are available under the GNU GPL. These may be freely
redistributed provided that you make the modified source code available.
A few libraries are available under the GNU LGPL. These may be
freely redistributed provided that you make the modified library source
code available and allow relinking with a newer version of the library.

<P>
Our understanding of all the copyrights involved in PM3 is that you can
safely distribute any program or library developed with PM3 provided that you
pass along the copyrights, the source code of the PM3 libraries used 
(at least for the LPGL libraries), and the relinkable binaries for
the rest (if you are using any LGPL libraries).
