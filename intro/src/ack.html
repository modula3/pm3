<P>Jerome Collin implemented the fast 
integrated backend for Linux ELF with
position independent code and debugging support.

<P>Louis-Dominique Dubeau reorganized the compiler and templates to
obtained a simplified single process m3build-m3-quake.

<P>
Tony Hosking, Purdue University, (hosking@cs.purdue.edu), ported the
incremental collector and stack based exceptions to Solaris. He is
working on Persistent Modula-3.

<P>Blair McIntyre brought several bug fixes and a new version of the
Pickle library (<a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~bm">Blair MacIntyre</a>).

<P>Richard Watts ported SRC Modula-3 to NT386 using the gnu-win32 linker,
obviating the need for the MS Visual C++ compiler/linker.

<P>Peter Klein (pk@i3.informatik.rwth-aachen.de)
produced a Modula-3 version of the TXL program parsing and
analysis tool, and a Modula-2 to Modula-3 converter.

<P>John Podstra developed CVSsup.

<P> The M3COCO parser generator was contributed by Ollie Stephens.

<H2>SRC Modula-3</H2>

<P>This section was written at DEC SRC and <I>we</I> presumably is
Bill Kalsow (Critical Mass, kalsow@cmass.com), Eric Muller,

<P>Many people contributed to SRC Modula-3, and we would like to thank them.
Below is a partial list of the contributors.

<P>

Thanks also to all the people who used SRC Modula-3 and reported bugs.

<P>
The various ports would have been impossible without the work of a
number of people, who kindly made their modifications available.
However, most of the bugs you may find in these ports were introduced
during the final integration of these modifications and we are to be
blamed for them.
