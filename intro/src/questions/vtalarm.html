<H1>Problems with threads, fork and VTALARM?</H1>
<P>
The threads are implemented using the virtual timer interrupt. Normally,
the run time environment will catch the interrupt and determine if
thread switching is appropriate. However, if a new process is created with
fork, it will have the virtual timer activated and no interrupt handler
to receive it, resulting in a core dump. If you use the standard procedure
Process.Create to fork new processes, this will be handled automatically
for you. If you insist on using fork, you need to disable the timer,
fork and then reenable the timer.
