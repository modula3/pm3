<H1>Why so many problems installing on Solaris?</H1>

<P>
These notes were contributed by (simon.hood@umist.ac.uk) while installing
PM3-1.1.14 on a Sun Ultra 5 running Solaris 2.8. They describe various
problems and their solution or workaround.

<P>
The installation of PM3 on Solaris systems is particularly prone to 
problems as these systems tend to be an unpredictable (from the point
of view of the PM3 people) mixture of Sun and Gnu software --- Sun
do <I>not</I> bundle a C compiler with the operating system.
</P>

<P>
My machine has gcc version 2.95.2 installed;  it has Sun's versions
of <B>make</B>, <B>ld</B>, <B>as</B> and <B>ar</B> installed 
within <TT>/usr/ccs/bin</TT>;  Gnu's version of these tools are not 
installed.
</P>
<P>
My installation was successful, after a bit of fiddling around with the
configuration/template files and environment variables.  Some of the fixes
are trivial (if you know what you are doing), while others --- for me at
least --- were not --- I am a Modula 3 novice and far from experienced 
with Solaris.
</P>
<P>
The issues that arose are:
<UL>
<LI>Paths needed to be set to find tools such as <B>make</B>.

<LI>LD_LIBRARY_PATH needed to be set to ensure 
    libstdc++.a.2.10.0 and/or libstdc++.so.2.10.0 were found.  

<LI>A link needed to be set so that <B>byacc</B> points to <B>yacc</B>.

<LI>The configuration for linking needed to be changed since only the Sun
    version of <B>ld</B> was installed, not Gnu's.  

<LI>The build of <B>m3gdb</B> failed to build.

<LI>The <B>gnuemacs</B> package failed to build.  
</UL>
</P>

<H2>Initial Problems</H2>
<P>
<DL>
<DT>Paths</DT>
<DD>
  <B>gcc</B> is usually installed in <TT>/usr/local/bin</TT>;  
  on a Solaris machine, <B>ar</B>, <B>as</B>, <B>make</B> and <B>ld</B>
  are all in <TT>/usr/ccs/bin</TT>, by default.  Hence these must both
  be on <B>root's</B> path (assuming you are installing as <B>root</B>).  
  Neither were;  I have not changed any paths since installation of
  Solaris 2.8 on a new machine a few days ago.
  <BR><BR>
  This is in addition to <TT>/usr/local/pm3/bin</TT>, as mentioned by 
  the PM3 installation instructions.
</DD>
<BR><BR>
<DT><TT>byacc/yacc</TT></DT>
<DD>
  The build required <B>byacc</B>.  <B>yacc</B> is installed in 
  <TT>/usr/ccs/bin</TT>;  a soft link:
  <PRE>
     lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     other          4 Aug 11 15:45 byacc -> yacc
  </PRE>
  solved this problem.  
</DD>
<BR><BR>
<DT>Library Paths</DT>
<DD>
  In addition to <TT>/usr/local/pm3/lib/m3</TT> as mentioned by the
  PM3 installation instructions <B>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</B> must include
  <TT>/usr/local/lib</TT> so that <B>libstdc++</B> (part of the <B>gcc</B> 
  distribution) can be found.  
</DD>
<BR><BR>
<DT>CC</DT>
<DD>
  In addition I found that the environment variable CC needed to be
  set to <TT>/usr/local/bin/gcc</TT>.  This is of course mentioned in
  the PM3 installation instructions.

<H2>Linking Problems</H2>
<P>
The two controlling configuration files for the SOLgnu distribution are
With the configuration files <TT>pm3-1.1.14/m3config/src/COMMON</TT> and
<TT>pm3-1.1.14/m3config/src/SOLgnu</TT>.  These appear to be set with
options appropriate to Gnu's <B>ld</B>.  Sun's <B>ld</B> does not understand
the option <TT>-soname &LT;thing&gt;</TT> and this leads to problems.  
</P>
<P>
Whilst compiling m3core (to obtain libm3core.a and libm3core.so) 
<PRE>
   ---------- building m3core in libs ----------
</PRE>
the following error message scrolled past (and did not cause the build to 
stop):
<PRE>
     -> archiving libm3core.a
   /usr/ccs/bin/ld: illegal option -- X
   /usr/ccs/bin/ld: illegal option -- X
   ld: fatal: file libm3core.so.1: open failed: No such file or directory
</PRE>
As a result the shared object (libm3core.so) is not built which leads to
<PRE>
  /usr/local/pm3/lib/m3/pkg/m3core/SOLgnu
    libm3core.so
 
   m3ship: quake error: quake error: runtime error: install failed with \
       error code: 1

       ../m3config/src/SOLgnu
   224 /export/home/simonh/__download/_m3/pm3-1.1.14/libs/m3core/SOLgnu/.M3SHIP
</PRE>
I made the following changes.  To <TT>pm3-1.1.14/m3config/COMMON</TT>,
within the procedure <TT>m3_make_shared_lib</TT>:
<PRE>
    %local cmd = [MAKESHLIB_CMD, "-o", lib_so, SONAME_OPTION, lib_sox, objects]
    local cmd = [MAKESHLIB_CMD, "-o", lib_so, objects]
</PRE>
(This stops the <TT>-soname &LT;thing&GT;</TT> option being sent to the linker.)

And to <TT>pm3-1.1.14/m3config/SOLgnu</TT>:
<PRE>
    %VERBOSE = ""
    VERBOSE = "T"
</PRE>
(to try to force the build to tell us more of what its actually doing --- the
commands it issues)
and
<PRE>
    %MAKESHLIB = [ "/usr/ccs/bin/ld", "-dy", "-G", "-z", "text" ]
    MAKESHLIB = ["gcc","-shared"]  % Shared library builder
</PRE>
which means that <B>gcc</B> is called to do the linking (it in turn calls
<TT>/usr/ccs/bin/ld</TT>).  
</P>

<P>
The above changes cured the problems I encountered with the build of the 
Modula 3 system itself.  In addition two packages --- <B>gnuemacs</B> 
and <B>m3gdb</B> --- failed to build.  I have not yet forced them to 
build successfully.  Details below.
</P>

<H2>The gnuemacs package</H2>

<P>
This package would not build.
The error message is given below.  The package requires that Gnu Emacs is
installed on the system.  Since it is not installed on all systems a flag
is available within <TT>pm3-1.1.14/src/m3makefile</TT><TT>...</TT>simply define it (to
anything):
<PRE>
      SKIP_GNUEMACS="T"
</PRE>
and this package will be skipped.  (Gnu Emacs *is* on my system, installed
under <TT>/usr/local</TT>;  I have not yet been able to build this package.)
</P>
