<H1> How to copy heap objects? </H1>
<P>
Deep copies are easily performed using Pickles. An object graph is
Pickled to a text writer into a TEXT. Then, a copy is created by
unpickling a new object graph from a text reader created from the
TEXT.
<P>
Shallow copies are less often needed but may be performed with the
following procedure:

<PRE><TT>
PROCEDURE Duplicate (r: REFANY): REFANY =
  VAR
    tc     := TYPECODE (r);
    n_dims : INTEGER;
    res    : REFANY;
    shape  : RTHeapRep.ArrayShape;
  BEGIN
    IF (r = NIL) THEN RETURN NIL END;

    (* allocate a new object of the same type (and shape) as the old one *)
    RTHeapRep.UnsafeGetShape (r, n_dims, shape);
    IF (n_dims &lt;= 0)
      THEN res := RTAllocator.NewTraced (tc);
      ELSE res := RTAllocator.NewTracedArray (tc, SUBARRAY(shape^, 0, n_dims));
    END;

    (* copy the old data into the new object *)
    RTMisc.Copy (RTHeap.GetDataAdr (r), RTHeap.GetDataAdr (res),
                 RTHeap.GetDataSize (r));

    RETURN res;
  END Duplicate;
