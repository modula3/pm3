Sprinkled throughout SRC m3 you'll find "constant" variables exported
in interfaces. For instance,
<PRE><TT> 
   VAR (*CONST*) Grain: LONGREAL;

where Grain is assigned during module initialization.
Instead, did the modula-3 designers consider doing this.
<PRE><TT>
   READONLY Grain: LONGREAL;
</TT></PRE>

Here the keyword permits only exporting modules to modify the 
Grain variable. Is there a problem with this proposal? The READONLY
keyword is successfully used at procedure boundaries, so why not 
also at interface boundaries?

A problem with this proposal is that any module can claim to export
the interface containing the variable, hence any module could modify
the variable.
Note that CONST says more than just READONLY.  CONST implies that the
variable should not be modified by clients and that once it is
initialized, it won't be changed later by the implementation.
READONLY would only mean that clients should not modify the variable.
IMO, the "right" solution would have been to allow:
<PRE><TT>
    INTERFACE Foo;
    CONST x: T;

    MODULE Foo;
    CONST x: T := &lt;value>;
</TT></PRE>
<P>
In the same way it checks revelations for opaque types, the compiler
could check that only one module provided a value for the constant.
But, this proposal doesn't quite hang together either.
Consider this example:
<PRE><TT>
    CONST x: INTEGER;
    VAR   v: [0..x];
</TT></PRE>
<P>
The language definition says that "v"s definition is illegal if "x < 0"
because its type is "empty".  The system could refuse to run the
program by delaying the check until it had seem the corresponding
implementation module.  But, I think you'll agree that it could
quickly turn into a mess.
The most flexible handling of opacity I've seen is in Christian
Collberg's PhD Thesis, "Flexible Encapsulation".  It was published Dec
5, 1992 by the CS Dept at Lund University, Lund Sweden.  If I remember
correctly, his system was capable of deferring all checks and
decisions imposed by opaque declarations until link time.
