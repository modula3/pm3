<P>
Modula-3 programs are slightly larger than C programs because the
generated code includes runtime type information, 
and runtime checks for out-of-bound array references and NIL pointers.
Many of these checks could be removed by a more sophisticated compiler.
<P>
The fixed runtime is substantially larger (there is no runtime support in C). 
It contains a garbage collector, a thread runtime, and exception support.
It is typically placed in a dynamically linked library, shared on disk
and in memory between all the Modula-3 programs.
