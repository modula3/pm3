<P>
The Modula-3 compiler m3 does a much finer grained dependency analysis than
possible with make. For this reason, a very flexible front end, m3build,
reads the program description files, m3makefile, and generates the commands
required to compile and link Modula-3 programs and libraries. The m3makefile
content is documented in the m3build documentation. Calling the m3 compiler
directly is difficult and thus not recommended, especially on PM3 where
it is now merged with m3build.
