I think that the OpenWindows release should be enough (no need to 
get the MIT X release), although there are a few things in Trestle
that trigger devastating bugs in OpenWindows. But the only library
we depend on is Xlib, R4 or later.

The main thing I know that crashes OW 2.0 is the code where we call 
GrabKey specifying AnyKey.  You can either loop over all of the 
keys, or you can just comment out the call; programs won't run exactly 
the same, but you probably won't notice the difference.
