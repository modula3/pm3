Modula-3 Writers are buffered. Thus, you need to issue a Wr.Flush when
the output should appear immediately, for instance to prompt the user
for some input. Since this can become annoying, libraries in other languages
sometimes offer the option of unbuffered writes. In Modula-3, an equivalent
behavior is obtained with AutoFlushWr which gets a background thread to
flush a writer at a specified interval.
