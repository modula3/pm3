<H1>Installation</H1>

<P>The latest version of PM3 may be obtained from m3.polymtl.ca by
<A HREF="http://www.elegosoft.com/pm3/download-pm3.html">FTP</A>,
<a href="http://www.elegosoft.com/pm3/cvsup-pm3.html">CVSup</a>, or
<a href="http://www.elegosoft.com/pm3/cvs-pm3.html">Anonymous CVS</a>.

<p>
  <b>Note:</b> This document is somewhat outdated, as it was written for
  installation from m3.polymtl.ca, which
  is no more online. I've made a quick attempt to change some things,
  but this won't be enough to be really accurate again, I'm afraid.
</p>

<H2>RPM installation</H2>

<P>For LINUXLIBC6, RPM source and binary packages are available
and may conveniently be installed with the <TT>rpm</TT> program. 
This way, for most cases, nothing special (e.g. setting environment variables)
should be required. It should be noted however that the default INSTALL_ROOT
for RPM packages is <TT>/usr</TT> instead of <TT>/usr/local/pm3</TT>,
thus for instance, in the installation instructions, 
directory /usr/local/pm3/lib/m3/<I>TARGET</I> in fact refers
to /usr/lib/m3/<I>TARGET</I>.

<H2>Binary Installation</H2>

<P>A binary distribution of PM3 contains executable programs, libraries,
and run time data files (scripts, bitmaps, document type definitions...).
It comes in a tar compressed file and may be untarred from the root
directory. As explained below, you need to set appropriately the PATH
environment variable, and possibly the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable on some of the platforms supporting shared libraries.
<P>
In the examples below, <I>TARGET</I> refers to the platform name and
should be replaced by LINUXELF, SPARC, SOLgnu... depending on your
target platform, and <I>version</I> refers to the PM3 version.
<P>
The PATH environment variable must contain the directory where the
executable programs reside, typically /usr/local/pm3/bin.
On platforms with shared libraries (dynamically linked), the dynamic linker
must find the shared libraries along its path. Typically, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable will need to include 
/usr/local/pm3/lib/m3/<I>TARGET</I>.
For some platforms (LINUXELF, SPARC, SOLgnu), the shared libraries paths 
are specified at link time and LD_LIBRARY_PATH need not contain 
anything, if the shared libraries are at the location specified at link time.
Be careful not to have LD_LIBRARY_PATH point to older versions of the
PM3 libraries, which is likely to cause problems for executing PM3 programs.
<P>
Some programs require data files at run time. The locations for these files may
be specified as a command line option for the program. Default locations
use the values specified in the m3config library. These values reflect
the compiler configuration templates at the time m3config was compiled.
For the compiler itself (m3build and m3ship), a more elaborate scheme is
used to find the templates. A command line option may be set 
(<TT>-T path</TT>), the <TT>M3TEMPLATES</TT> environment variable may be
specified, and the m3config library values serve as default location.
Failing that, the <TT>PATH</TT> environment variable is used to locate
<TT>m3build</TT> and the templates are assume to be reachable from there
using the relative path <TT>../lib/m3/pkg/m3config/src</TT>. Because of this,
the compiler finds automatically the templates in most cases, and the
installation may look like (the ftp transfer is only needed if you dont use
the simpler WWW download menu):
<PRE><TT>
cassis> cd
cassis>ftp www.elegosoft.com
ftp> binary
ftp> cd pub/pm3/
ftp> ls
ftp> get pm3-bin-<i>version</i>.tar.gz
ftp> quit
cassis> cd /
cassis> tar xpfz ~/pm3-bin-<i>version</i>.tar.gz
cassis> rm ~/pm3-bin-<i>version</i>.tar.gz
cassis> setenv PATH /usr/local/pm3/bin:${PATH}
cassis> setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH \
> /usr/local/pm3/lib/m3/<I>TARGET</I>:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
cassis>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
In rare cases, (e.g. if the system libraries are at an unusual location),
you may need to modify the templates in order to reflect your system
configuration. This is achieved by examining the content
of /usr/local/pm3/lib/m3/pkg/m3config/src/COMMON and
overriding the improper variables and functions in the
platform specific template 
/usr/local/pm3/lib/m3/pkg/m3config/src/<I>TARGET</I>.

<H2>Source only Installation</H2>
<P>
For a source only distribution, you need a compatible version of m3build and
m3ship already installed. The PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variables also need to be set properly as explained in the previous section.
You may then customize the compiler configuration files in m3config/src,
select the packages to compile in src/PACKAGES,
and then proceed with the compilation and installation 
(<TT>m3build</TT>). Typically the source is downloaded through the
WWW download menu, and the ftp transfer may be omitted from the 
following procedure.

<PRE><TT>
cassis> cd
cassis>ftp www.elegosoft.com
ftp> binary
ftp> cd pub/pm3
ftp> ls
ftp> get pm3-src-<I>version</I>.tar.gz
ftp> quit
cassis> tar xpfz pm3-src-<I>version</I>.tar.gz
cassis> rm pm3-src-<I>version</I>.tgz
cassis> setenv PATH /usr/local/pm3/bin:${PATH}
cassis> setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH \
> /usr/local/pm3/lib/m3/<I>TARGET</I>:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
cassis> cd <I>version</I>
cassis> m3build
</TT></PRE>

<H2>Bootstrap Source Installation</H2>
<P>
The bootstrap for a platform contains the assembly source for all the files
comprising m3build and m3ship, and suitable makefiles. 
The PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables need to be set properly as
in the previous sections. You may then customize the top level bootstrap
makefile <TT>Makefile</TT> if needed, customize
the compiler configuration files in m3config/src,
select the packages to compile in src/m3makefile,
and then proceed with the compilation and installation (<TT>make</TT>).
The WWW download menu allows one to download the bootstrap and source
as a single file.

<PRE><TT>
cassis> cd
cassis>ftp www.elegosoft.com
ftp> binary
ftp> cd /pub/pm3
ftp> ls
ftp> get pm3-src-<I>version</I>.tar.gz
ftp> get pm3-<I>version</I>-boot.tgz boot.tgz
ftp> quit
cassis> tar xpfz pm3-src-<I>version</I>.tar.gz
cassis> tar xpfz ../boot.tgz
cassis> rm pm3-src-<I>version</I>.tar.gz boot.tgz
cassis> cd pm3
cassis> setenv PATH /usr/local/pm3/bin:${PATH}
cassis> setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH \
> /usr/local/pm3/lib/m3/<I>TARGET</I>:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
cassis> make
</TT></PRE>

<H2>Calling the correct support tools</H2>

<P>
Users with non-standard environments may encounter installation problems,
and must take special care to ensure that the necessary tools (C compiler,
assembler, etc.) are correctly located by the boot <tt>Makefile</tt>. This
warning applies especially to Solaris users, since the Sun C
compiler is sold and installed separately from other systems tools,
and hybrid Solaris/GNU environments seem to be fairly common.
   
<P>
In general, the machine's native assembler, C compiler, and "make"
must be used in preference to GNU's. Obvious exceptions are the
Linux versions, for which "native" means "GNU"; and the SOLgnu
version, for which one must use the native assembler together with
GNU's <tt>gcc</tt> and <tt>make</tt>.

<P> 
Users should therefore prune their command directory list
(<tt>$PATH</tt> in most shells) to the bare minimum, making sure
that the native command directories appear before alternative ones
(such as GNU's). In particular, the <tt>$PATH</tt> must not include
any previous Modula-3 installation. Also, the shell environment
variables <tt>$AS</tt>, <tt>$CC</tt>, and <tt>$MAKE</tt> should be
set to the <em>absolute</em> pathnames of the corresponding
executables. By the same token, all program names specified in the
template file (<tt>"m3config/src/platform</tt>) should be absolute
pathnames.
