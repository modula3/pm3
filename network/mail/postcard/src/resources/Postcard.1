.SH "SYNTAX"
.PP
\fBPostcard\fR
[ \fB\-display\fR \fIname\fR ]
[ \fB\-geometry WxH+X+Y]\fR ]
[ \fB\-longFolders\fR ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Postcard is a user interface for reading and composing personal
electronic mail, and for reading newsgroups and bulletin boards.
It combines in an X\-windows interface most of the functions of mail
handling programs such as \fBmh\fR or \fBxmh\fR, and news\-reading programs
such as \fBrn\fR or \fBxrn\fR.
.PP
In addition, Postcard provides an integrated user interface for
browsing the accumulated spool of newsgroups and bulletin boards,
with a query language that includes full text indexing.  This
browsing is done through the
ni(1)
news indexing program.
.PP
Just like mh, Postcard keeps \fImessages\fR in \fIfolders\fR.  (There is
no nesting of folders.)  One folder, \fIinbox\fR, is special: it is
where your newly arrived personal electronic mail is placed.  You
can create other private folders and copy or move messages into
them.  You can also create folders that correspond to newsgroups
    (or bulletin boards).  In many ways these behave like your other
folders, except that they are read\-only.  When new articles appear
in a newsgroup, they automatically appear in your corresponding
folder. You can also create aliases for newsgroups and for folders
shared with other users.
.PP
Postcard uses the same file and directory structures for storing
messages as 
mh(1).
Indeed, it uses the various mh programs for
most access to messages.  Postcard does not interfere with use of
rn, although it does not use rn's list of active newsgroups, nor
rn's kill file.  Postcard is compatible with some mail polling
programs, such as \fBfaces \-a\fR; it is incompatible with \fBxbiff\fR.
.PP
Postcard uses an X\-Server for all its user interactions.  Postcard
is programmed in Modula\-3, using the Trestle and VBTKit toolkit
and the FormsVBT interface\-description system.
.PP
Postcard has a built\-in editor for message composition, but it
also lets you use an external editor of your choice, such as
    \fBemacs\fR, \fBepoch\fR, or \fBvi\fR.
.PP
Postcard has been debugged using version 6.7.1 of mh.  Your
mileage might differ if you have a different version installed in
your local environment.  Note that, unlike previous versions, mh
version 6 allows more than 999 messages in a folder.
.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
All of Postcard's documentation is built\-in to the application.
Click \*(lqhelp\*(rq on the general menu (at the top\-left of the main
window, looking like a U.S. Mail box). That produces a \*(lqhelp\*(rq
window, with buttons to provide detailed explanations of
Postcard's operations.  Please use the help window's \fBNext\fR
button to skim the documentation at least once.
.SH "INSTALLATION"
Postcard itself is a single unprivileged program, and needs no
installation \- just run it, as described below in 
Starting Postcard.  
However, Postcard uses several other programs. 
Postcard finds most of these subsidiary programs by their simple
name, looked up according to your PATH environment variable.  You
    (the user) or your system administrator should make sure these
programs are accessible.
.PP
Postcard requires the mh(1) system, version 6.7 or later.  From
mh(1), Postcard uses \fBinc\fR, \fBscan\fR, \fBrefile\fR, \fBrmm\fR, 
    \fBfolder\fR, \fBsortm\fR and \fBsend\fR.
.PP
Postcard requires \fB/bin/rm\fR, \fBbin/ls\fR, and  \fB/usr/ucb/from\fR,
each of which is referenced by absolute pathname.  Postcard
invokes /bin/rm with the \fB\-r\fR option to delete recursively, and
invokes /bin/ls with no options.  It uses \fB/usr/ucb/from\fR to
count the number of messages in your inbox \- all that Postcard
does is count the number of newline in the output.
.PP
Postcard requires the program \fBllscan\fR, which is available from SRC. 
.PP
Postcard uses the program \fBni\fR to implement the \*(lqBrowse Discussion\*(rq
command and the commands in Postcard's \*(lqNI Query\*(rq dialog; if \fBni\fR
is not available, Postcard will give you an error message when you
use those commands.
.PP
Postcard can also use various other programs that you explicitly
choose in the \*(lqSet Configuration\*(rq dialog, for printing, external
editing, and PostScript previewing.  See the \*(lqhelp\*(rq popups in the
configuration dialog for more information on these commands.
.PP
If you want to use Postcard to read newsgroups and bulletin boards,
they must be available for direct file access, generally in the
directory /usr/spool/news.  If you are using them, your system
administrator should create a \*(lq.purge\*(rq file in a newsgroup
directory whenever messages there are purged or renumbered, so that
Postcard will rescan the directory.
.SH "STARTING POSTCARD"
Postcard takes about half a minute to start upon a modern
workstation; you'll probably want start Postcard and leave it
running until the machine crashes or a new version of Postcard
comes along.
.PP
You start Postcard with the \fBPostcard\fR command; this creates a
window on your display.  All your interaction with Postcard is
centered around this window.
.PP
On the command line with the \fBPostcard\fR command you can give a
    \fB\-geometry\fR parameter to specify the width, height and position of
the main window.  The value of this parameter is in the standard
WxH+X+Y format, e.g. \*(lq640x480+0+0\*(rq.  The numbers in this parameter
are pixels.  Positions are measured from the top left of the display
if positive, and the bottom right if negative.  You can also provide
a 
    \fB\-display\fR 
parameter to name the X\-server and particular display
for the main window.  Postcard creates its other windows when
needed, near the main window.
.PP
The \fB\-longFolders\fR parameter requests a slightly different layout
for Postcard's main window, with the folder list all the way down
the right hand side.
.PP
It's generally safe to run multiple copies of Postcard (e.g. in
order to display on your X\-server at work as well as your X\-server
at home).  But this is safe only if the multiple copies are
executing on the same computer (or you're not using NFS).  And the
multiple copies will not track additions and removals of folders,
nor changes made with the Postcard configuration dialog.  You might
also get confused when there are file system errors, but the
applications will try their best to avoid losing data in those
cases.  Don't try to interact with multiple copies of Postcard
simultaneously \- the algorithms assume there's a delay of at least
one minute between your using one copy of Postcard and using the
other one.
.PP
Postcard relies on a lot of files, programs, and settings from your
environment.  The most important of these are as follows; section
    5 describes many additional configuration options, and more
environment variables are mentioned below under 
ENVIRONMENT. 
.PP
Most systems provide suitable defaults for all of the settings
automatically.
.PD 0
.RS 0
.TP 6
$PATH
This environment variable must be set to a search
path that provides access to the mh and ni commands.
.IP
.TP 6
$DISPLAY
This environment variable describes the display
for your X\-Server, e.g. \*(lqtokay.pa.dec.com:0.0\*(rq.
.IP
.TP 6
$HOME
This environment variable should be the name of
your user directory, e.g. \*(lq/udir/birrell\*(rq.
.IP
.TP 6
$USER
This environment variable should be your user name
as used for mail, e.g. \*(lqbirrell\*(rq.  Case sensitive.
.IP
.TP 6
$HOME/Mail
The directory containing your mail folders, as
for \fBmh\fR.  Must be writable, and should contain at
least \*(lqinbox\*(rq (though you can create this in
Postcard).
.RE
.PD
.PP
While Postcard is running it creates directories in $HOME/Mail
when you create folders.  It stores your Postcard configuration
in $HOME/.postcardFV_rc and draft messages in $HOME/.pc_draft;
it can use an alias file from $HOME/.mail_aliases.sx
.PP
The mh commands used by Postcard require an mh profile in
    $HOME/.mh_profile.  You probably already have one, but if not you
should acquire one from a friend, or read the mh documentation.
.SH "ERROR RECOVERY"
Postcard does not have a generalized undo mechanism, but there are
several ad hoc ways to recover from a mistake.  If you [move] a
message to the wrong folder, just open that folder and [move] it
to the correct one.
.PP
If you are worried about mistakes with [delete], you can use the
Postcard option to have [delete] work by copying the message to
a \*(lqdeleted\*(rq folder (see the help information in the configuration
dialog).  If you decide to use this option, you should try to keep
your \*(lqdeleted\*(rq folder down to a reasonable size by using the Purge
command in the Folders menu when you have your \*(lqdeleted\*(rq folder
open.
.PP
If you don't use the \*(lqdeleted\*(rq folder option, it is still possible
to recover a message you accidentally deleted with the [delete]
button.  The message is not destroyed immediately.  Instead, the
message file is renamed to begin with a comma.  These \*(lqcomma files\*(rq
may disappear, however: if you subsequently delete a second message
with the same number (i.e., after an [inc] or a \*(lqSort & Pack\*(rq), its
comma file will overwrite the earlier one.  Also many installations
include daemons that delete such files overnight.  So you have a
short period of grace in which to recover your accidentally deleted
message.  Just use a shell window to look in the directory
corresponding to the folder you had open, e.g.:
.EX
tokay 1> cd ~/Mail/inbox
tokay 2> ls 
.EE
Look for the comma file corresponding to the message you deleted,
and note the highest existing message number.  Rename the comma
file to a message number not in use (such as the number of the
message you deleted, if possible):
.EX
srcff 3> mv ,27 27
.EE
Then go back to Postcard and use the Rescan command in the Folder
menu.  Your message will reappear in the browser.
.PP
If this fails, but the message you accidentally deleted had been
in your folder for at least 24 hours, it may be possible to recover
it from backup tapes.
.PP
Restoring files from backup tapes is not something that the system
manager has time to do routinely, but he or she is willing to do
it in an emergency.
.PP
The text of a draft message in a composition sub\-window is written
to a file in the $HOME/.pc_draft directory within 30 seconds of
each edit that you make to it.  These files are named \*(lq1\*(rq, \*(lq2\*(rq,
etc.; the names are re\-used as composition sub\-windows are
re\-used.  Postcard normally recovers these files automatically on
a restart if you had an unsent draft.  When you click \*(lqdiscard\*(rq or
after a successful \*(lqsend\*(rq, the message file is stored in a
simlarly named file in $HOME/.pc_draft, but with its name prefixed
by \*(lq,\*(rq.
.PP
Sometimes your $HOME/.mh_profile file can get into a state that
will confuse the mh programs. A symptom of this is persistent
strange messages including the name of an mh program (e.g. \fBscan\fR
or \fBinc\fR). You can often recover from this by deleting
    $HOME/.mh_profile or by copying that file a friend.
.SH "BUGS"
Postcard maintenance is handled at SRC by 
Andrew Birrell. 
Report  bugs in Postcard by sending a message to \fBBirrell@pa.dec.com\fR. If
possible, include the version number, from the \*(lqAbout Postcard\*(rq
dialog.
.SH "WARNINGS"
To improve interactiveness, Postcard executes time\-consuming
operations in the background while giving the illusion that they
are done immediately.  This can confuse you if you look at
Postcard's part of the file system using other means.  To be sure
no background operations are in progress, click on the \*(lqinc\*(rq button,
open a different folder, or exit Postcard; each of these actions
waits for the background queue to empty.
.PP
If you use mh and Postcard concurrently, it is possible that
Postcard's internal cache of mail information can be incorrect.
Postcard is only smart enough to detect whether a folder directory
has been modified at the time it opens it.  If you modify the
mail information through other means other than Postcard (i.e.,
using mh from home), simply use the Rescan comand in
the Folder menu.  This will bring Postcard up to date.
.SH "MAINTENANCE NOTES"
During bulletin board upheavals, it is sometimes useful for the
bulletin board wizards to force an automatic rescan the next time a
user opens a particular bulletin board.  This is done by creating a
file .purge in the actual /usr/spool/news directory associated with
the bulletin board.  If a user's own cache is out of date with
respect to this file, a complete rescan will be performed.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Postcard uses several environment variables, and the various mh
programs use some more. The ones used explicitly by Postcard are
as follows.
.PD 0
