(* Since we need to use the Mutex properties of Rd.T and Wr.T, we
   should actually import UnsafeWr and UnsafeRd. We need to add the
   following revelations, as the comment in UnsafeRd points out, if we
   want to include both the Unsafe* and *Class interfaces. *)

  (* the shared data between the reader and writer corresponds to the
     locking elements and the pointers into the shared buffer.  The closed
     flag is used for the reader/writer to communicate if they are
     close()d. *)

  (* If there is no data in the buffer, first_i = next_i, and the reader
     may block.  Otherwise, first_i points at the first character in the
     shared buffer available for reading, and next_i points at the the
     first character available for writing.  If (next_i + 1) MOD size =
     first_i, the buffer is full, and the writer may block.

     At any given time, rd.st will be first_i.  rd.cur <= rd.hi will fall
     in the area between first_i and next_i.

     wr.st will be next_i.  wr.cur <= wr.hi will fall in the free area
     between next_i and first_i.

     wr.flush() will sync the writer, so that next_i, wr.st and wr.lo will
     be advanced to correspond to wr.cur, "flushing" the buffered writer
     output so the reader can get at it. *)
