<H1>Reachability Examples</H1>
<P>

These examples were suggested by Umesh Maheshwari
(umesh@note.lcs.mit.edu).<P>

<H2>Example 1</H2>

Our first example consists of a program built from two packages: a
library package named <I>LibPkg</I> and a program package named
<I>ProgPkg</I>.<P>

The <I>LibPkg</I> package consists of three source files: "X.i3",
"Y.i3", and "Y.m3".<P>

<PRE>
  INTERFACE X;              INTERFACE Y;
  TYPE T &lt;: ROOT;           END Y.
  END X.
  
  MODULE Y;
  IMPORT X; 
  REVEAL X.T = ROOT BRANDED OBJECT c: CHAR END;
  BEGIN END Y.
</PRE>

The <I>m3makefile</I> for package <I>LibPkg</I> is:<P>

<PRE>
  import(libm3)
  Interface(X)
  Module(Y)
  Library(LibPkg)
</PRE>

The <I>ProgPkg</I> package consists of a single source file,
"Main.m3".<P>

<PRE>
  MODULE Main;
  IMPORT X;
  BEGIN END Main.
</PRE>

The <I>m3makefile</I> for package <I>ProgPkg</I> is:<P>

<PRE>
  override(LibPkg, "../..")
  import(libm3)
  import(LibPkg)
  implementation(Main)
  program(Prog)
</PRE>

The unit graph constructed by the linker when it builds the
<I>ProgPkg</I> program looks like this:<P>

<IMG SRC="Example1.gif" ALT="[ Image for Figure 1 ]"><P>

In this and subsequent figures, the roots are colored red, the
reachable non-roots are colored blue, and the edges are labeled "I" or
"E" to denote that the edge is due to an IMPORT or EXPORTS relation,
respectively. Hence, the colored nodes correspond to the units
included in the final build.<P>

Since the units "Y.m3" and "Y.i3" are not reachable from the single
root "Main.m3", the linker does not include them in the build. Hence,
the linker does not find a concrete revelation for the type "X.T".
When we run <I>m3build</I> on the <I>ProgPkg</I> package, the compiler
prints out the following error message:<P>

<PRE>
   -> linking Prog
  opaque type never revealed: _tb81ca1e6
    defined in X.i3
</PRE>

The problem can be avoided in a number of ways, as shown in the
following three examples.

<H2>Example 2</H2>

If we change "Main.m3" so that it imports "Y" as well as "X", the unit
graph changes to look like this:<P>

<IMG SRC="Example2.gif" ALT="[ Image for Figure 2 ]"><P>

Now, both "Y.i3" and "Y.m3" are reachable from the root, so the linker
finds a concrete revelation for "X.T", and the program builds
successfully.<P>

<H2>Example 3</H2>

Starting from Example 1, we can instead export the interface "X" in
the module "Y", like this:<P>

<PRE>
  MODULE Y EXPORTS X, Y;
  IMPORT X; 
  REVEAL X.T = ROOT BRANDED OBJECT c: CHAR END;
  BEGIN END Y.
</PRE>

This adds a new EXPORTS edge to the unit graph:<P>

<IMG SRC="Example3.gif" ALT="[ Image for Figure 3 ]"><P>

Now, "Y.m3" has become reachable from the root "Main.m3" through
"X.i3", so the linker again finds a concrete revelation for "X.T", and
the program builds successfully.<P>

<H2>Example 4</H2>

Starting from the source files of Example 1, we can move all of the
<I>LibPkg</I> sources into the <I>ProgPkg</I> package. The
<I>m3makefile</I> for the <I>ProgPkg</I> then becomes:<P>

<PRE>
  import(libm3)
  interface(X)
  module(Y)
  implementation(Main)
  program(Prog)
</PRE>

This doesn't change the unit graph from Example 1, but it does
makes all four of the sources roots:<P>

<IMG SRC="Example4.gif" ALT="[ Image for Figure 4 ]"><P>

Hence, "Y.m3" is once again seen by the linker, and the program builds
successfully.<P>
