<H1>Thread scheduling</H1>
<P>

SRC Modula-3 has a flexible scheduling algorithm.
Here is a rough explanation of its behaviour.
<P>

All threads are kept in a circular list. This list is
modified only when new threads are created or when they exit; that
is, the relative order of threads in this list is never modified.
<P>

When the scheduler comes into action, the list of threads is scanned
starting with the thread following the one currently running, until
a thread that can execute is found:
<UL>
<LI> if it was preempted by the scheduler or called
<TT>Scheduler.Yield</TT>,
it can execute

<LI> if it is waiting for a condition or a mutex that is now free,
it can execute

<LI> if it has blocked because of a call to
<TT>Thread.Pause</TT>
(or a similar procedure), it can execute iff the timeout has expired

<LI> if it has blocked because of a call to
<TT>SchedulerPosix.IOWait</TT>,
(or a similar procedure), it can execute iff the timeout is now expired 
or a polling <TT>select(2)</TT> returns a non-zero value.
</UL>
<P>

If such a thread is found, it becomes active. 
<P>

If no thread can execute, and there are no threads blocked in a
<TT>Thread.Pause</TT>
or a
<TT>SchedulerPosix.IOWait</TT>,
a deadlock situation is detected
and reported. Otherwise, a combination of the file descriptors sets
(OR of all the file descriptors sets) and timeouts (MIN of all the
timeouts) is formed, <TT>select(2)</TT> is called with those arguments
and the whole process of searching for an executable thread is redone.
This ensures that the Unix process does not consume CPU resources while
waiting.
<P>

The scheduler is activated when the running thread tries to acquire a
mutex which is locked, waits for a condition, calls
<TT>Thread.Pause</TT>
(or a similar procedure) with a future time, calls
<TT>SchedulerPosix.IOWait</TT>
(or a similar procedure) with a non-zero valued timeout and no files
are ready at the time of the call, or the time allocated to the thread
has expired (preemption).
<P>

Preemption is implemented using the Unix virtual interval timer.
SRC Modula-3 does not use the real time interval
timer nor the profiling interval timer for thread scheduling; these
are available to the program.
<P>

Because of the preemption implementation, Unix kernel calls
will block the process (i.e. the Unix process sleeps even though
some threads could run).  However,
<TT>Thread.Pause</TT>
and
<TT>SchedulerPosix.IOWait</TT>
provide functional equivalents of
<TT>sigpause(2)</TT> and
<TT>select(2)</TT> that do not cause the process to block.
