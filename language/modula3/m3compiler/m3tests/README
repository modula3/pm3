This directory contains test programs for the Modula-3 compiler. 

These tests are intended to be used by the people working on the
compiler.

There are 5 types of tests:

  1. CODE tests: tiny modules where the code output by the compiler
      is what's of interest.
  2. PROG tests: complete programs where the output of the program
      is what's of interest.
  3. ERROR tests: modules containing static errors where the generated
       error messages are of interest.
  4. RUNTIME tests: modules containing runtime error where the generated
       error messages are of interest.
  5. MISC tests (x): programs or modules that require a human to test
       because they have non-deterministic or timing dependent behavior.

The following tests are known to fail in the current release (2.0):

        - p031  is non-deterministic
        - p090  ADR(VALUE REAL FORMAL) mips cc generates bad code
        - p096  elaborate constant methods.  no hope.
        - e015, e018, e022, e028 illegal recursive declarations

The following tests are known to fail in the current release (1.6):

	- c056
	- c094
	- c115
	- c121
        - p059, on DS3100 when optimization is enabled. 
                (this is actually a bug in cc, Ultrix 4.0)
        - p083
