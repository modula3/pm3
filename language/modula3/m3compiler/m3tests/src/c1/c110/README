Subject: m3 compiler bug

I finally tracked this one down.  I think a semantic error message
would be a lot more helpful than the compiler dying with an assertion
failure.  (Assuming, of course, that TEXT and ARRAY OF CHAR really are
different (TEXT being opaque and all...).  Don't ask me how I feel
about TEXT.)  This is on a SPARCstation 1+ running SunOS 4.0.3c .

MODULE boom;

PROCEDURE A(x: ARRAY OF CHAR)= BEGIN END A;

VAR 
  nameT: TEXT;

BEGIN
  A(nameT);
END boom.
