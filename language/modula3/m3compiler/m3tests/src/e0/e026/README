Subject: Question about BRANDED

I've got a question about brands. The report says:
	'All brands in a program must be distinct'

Does that mean all brands in a module have to be distinct
or does that mean all brands in all modules of a program
have to be distinct ?

I got a little bit confused, because m3 compiles the following 
program without warnings and the executable doesn't raise an exception: 

MODULE a
	EXPORTS Main;

	TYPE b = BRANDED "string" REF INTEGER;
	TYPE d = BRANDED "string" REF INTEGER;

VAR a: b;
    c: d;
BEGIN
      a := c;
END a.

Is the program correct ?

Have 'a' and 'c' the same type ?



Thomas
