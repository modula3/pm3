Subject: Array bug
Date: Tue, 08 May 90 11:06:43 +0100
From: mjj%computer-lab.cambridge.ac.uk@NSFnet-Relay.AC.UK
Message-Id:  <9005081106.aa04053@gnnt.Cl.Cam.AC.UK>

The following code generates a compiler bug. The C structure declared for
the constructor "Array{1,2}" doesn not have a 'size' field, leading to obvious
problems in "Open".

Mick
 
MODULE Bug3 EXPORTS Main;


TYPE
  Array = ARRAY OF INTEGER;

PROCEDURE Open(READONLY a: Array) RAISES {}=
  VAR c := NEW(REF Array, NUMBER(a));
  BEGIN
  END Open;

BEGIN
   Open(Array{1,2});
END Bug3.
