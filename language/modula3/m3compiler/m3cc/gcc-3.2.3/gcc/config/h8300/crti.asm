/* The code in sections .init and .fini is supposed to be a single
   regular function.  The function in .init is called directly from
   start in crt0.asm.  The function in .fini is atexit()ed in crt0.asm
   too.

   crti.asm contributes the prologue of a function to these sections,
   and crtn.asm comes up the epilogue.  STARTFILE_SPEC should list
   crti.o before any other object files that might add code to .init
   or .fini sections, and ENDFILE_SPEC should list crtn.o after any
   such object files.  */
