   The -bhalt:4 option supposedly changes the level at which ld will abort,
   but it also suppresses warnings about multiply defined symbols and is
   used by the AIX cc command.  So we use it here.

   -bnodelcsect undoes a poor choice of default relating to multiply-defined
   csects.  See AIX documentation for more information about this.

   -bM:SRE tells the linker that the output file is Shared REusable.  Note
   that to actually build a shared library you will also need to specify an
   export list with the -Wl,-bE option.

   If -mcpu=common, export the architecture dependent multiply/divide routines
   as per README.RS6000.  */
