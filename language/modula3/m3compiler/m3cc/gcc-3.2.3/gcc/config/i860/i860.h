	`L'	The operand is a numeric constant, a constant address, or
		a memory ref to a constant address.  Print the correct
		notation to yield the low part of the given value or
		address or the low part of the address of the referred
		to memory object.

	`H'	The operand is a numeric constant, a constant address, or
		a memory ref to a constant address.  Print the correct
		notation to yield the high part of the given value or
		address or the high part of the address of the referred
		to memory object.

	`h'	The operand is a numeric constant, a constant address, or
		a memory ref to a constant address.  Either print the
		correct notation to yield the plain high part of the
		given value or address (or the plain high part of the
		address of the memory object) or else print the correct
		notation to yield the "adjusted" high part of the given
		address (or of the address of the referred to memory object).

		The choice of what to print depends upon whether the address
		in question is relocatable or not.  If it is relocatable,
		print the notation to get the adjusted high part.  Otherwise
		just print the notation to get the plain high part.  Note
		that "adjusted" high parts are generally used *only* when
		the next following instruction uses the low part of the
		address as an offset, as in `offset(reg)'.

	`R'	The operand is a floating-pointer register.  Print the
		name of the next following (32-bit) floating-point register.
		(This is used when moving a value into just the most
		significant part of a floating-point register pair.)

	`?'	(takes no operand) Substitute the value of i860_reg_prefix
		at this point.  The value of i860_reg_prefix is typically
		a null string for most i860 targets, but for System V
		Release 4 the i860 assembler syntax requires that all
		names of registers be prefixed with a percent-sign, so
		for SVR4, the value of i860_reg_prefix is initialized to
		"%" in i860.c.

/* Optionally define this if you have added predicates to
   `MACHINE.c'.  This macro is called within an initializer of an
   array of structures.  The first field in the structure is the
   name of a predicate and the second field is an array of rtl
   codes.  For each predicate, list all rtl codes that can be in
   expressions matched by the predicate.  The list should have a
   trailing comma.  Here is an example of two entries in the list
   for a typical RISC machine:

   #define PREDICATE_CODES \
     {"gen_reg_rtx_operand", {SUBREG, REG}},  \

   Defining this macro does not affect the generated code (however,
   incorrect definitions that omit an rtl code that may be matched
   by the predicate can cause the compiler to malfunction). 
   Instead, it allows the table built by `genrecog' to be more
   compact and efficient, thus speeding up the compiler.  The most
   important predicates to include in the list specified by this
   macro are thoses used in the most insn patterns.  */
