/* Number of actual hardware registers.
   The hardware registers are assigned numbers for the compiler
   from 0 to just below FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER.
   All registers that the compiler knows about must be given numbers,
   even those that are not normally considered general registers.

   29k has 256 registers, of which 62 are not defined.  gr0 and gr1 are
   not produced in generated RTL so we can start at gr96, and call it
   register zero.

   So 0-31 are gr96-gr127, lr0-lr127 are 32-159.  To represent the input
   arguments, whose register numbers we won't know until we are done,
   use register 160-175.  They cannot be modified.  Similarly, 176 is used
   for the frame pointer.  It is assigned the last local register number
   once the number of registers used is known.

   We use 177, 178, 179, and 180 for the special registers BP, FC, CR, and Q,
   respectively.  Registers 181 through 199 are used for the other special
   registers that may be used by the programmer, but are never used by the
   compiler.

   Registers 200-203 are the four floating-point accumulator register in
   the 29050.

   Registers 204-235 are the 32 global registers for kernel mode when
   -mkernel-registers is not specified, and the 32 global user registers
   when it is.

   When -mkernel-registers is specified, we still use the same register
   map but change the names so 0-31 print as gr64-gr95.  */

/* Define the classes of registers for register constraints in the

   One of the classes must always be named ALL_REGS and include all hard regs.
   If there is more than one class, another class must be named NO_REGS
   and contain no registers.

   The name GENERAL_REGS must be the name of a class (or an alias for
   another name such as ALL_REGS).  This is the class of registers
   that is allowed by "g" or "r" in a register constraint.
   Also, registers outside this class are allocated only when
   instructions express preferences for them.

   The classes must be numbered in nondecreasing order; that is,
   a larger-numbered class must never be contained completely
   in a smaller-numbered class.

   For any two classes, it is very desirable that there be another
   class that represents their union.
   
   The 29k has nine registers classes: LR0_REGS, GENERAL_REGS, SPECIAL_REGS,
   BP_REGS, FC_REGS, CR_REGS, Q_REGS, ACCUM_REGS, and ACCUM0_REGS.
   LR0_REGS, BP_REGS, FC_REGS, CR_REGS, and Q_REGS contain just the single
   register.  The latter two classes are used to represent the floating-point
   accumulator registers in the 29050.  We also define the union class
   FLOAT_REGS to represent any register that can be used to hold a
   floating-point value.  The union of SPECIAL_REGS and ACCUM_REGS isn't
   useful as the former cannot contain floating-point and the latter can only
   contain floating-point.  */
