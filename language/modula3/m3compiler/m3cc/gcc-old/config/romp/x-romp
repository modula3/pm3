# obstack.h assumes that if __STDC__ is defined an ANSI C preprocessor is
# being used.  -Hnocpp makes hc use its builtin preprocessor instead of
# /lib/cpp.  gcc doesn't use <sys/ioctl.h>, so it doesn't matter whether
# fixincludes has been run.

# hc's warnings do nothing but obscure the output, hence the -w.

# The default `make' on the RT doesn't define MAKE, so do it here.
