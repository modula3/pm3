                     Installing GCC: Final installation

   Now that GCC has been built and tested, you can install it with `cd
   _objdir_; make install' for a native compiler or `cd _objdir_; make
   install LANGUAGES="c c++"' for a cross compiler (note installing cross
   compilers will be easier in the next release!).

   That step completes the installation of GCC; user level binaries can
   be found in _prefix_/bin where _prefix_ is the value you specified
   with the --prefix to configure (or /usr/local by default).

   If you don't mind, please quickly review the [1]build status page. If
   your system is not listed, send a note to [2]gcc@gcc.gnu.org
   indicating that you successfully built and installed GCC.

   Include the output from running _srcdir_/config.guess. (Do not send us
   the config.guess file itself, just the output from running it!)

   If you find a bug, please report it following our [3]bug reporting
   guidelines.
