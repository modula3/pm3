   The latest version of this document is always available at
   [1]http://gcc.gnu.org/install/.

   This document describes the generic installation procedure for GCC as
   well as detailing some target specific installation instructions.

   GCC includes several components that previously were separate
   distributions with their own installation instructions. This document
   supersedes all package specific installation instructions. We provide
   the component specific installation information in the source
   distribution for historical reference purposes only.

   _Before_ starting the build/install procedure please check the
   [2]host/target specific installation notes. We recommend you browse
   the entire generic installation instructions before you proceed.

   The installation procedure itself is broken into five steps.
    1. [3]Downloading the source
    2. [4]Configuration
    3. [5]Building
    4. [6]Testing (optional)
    5. [7]Final install

   Please note that GCC does not support `make uninstall` and probably
   won't do so in the near future as this would open a can of worms.
   Instead, we suggest that you install GCC into a directory of its own
   and simply remove that directory when you do not need that specific
   version of GCC any longer.
