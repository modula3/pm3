<h1 align="center">Installing GCC</h1>

<p>The latest version of this document is always available at <a href="
http://gcc.gnu.org/install/">http://gcc.gnu.org/install/</a>.

<p>This document describes the generic installation procedure for GCC as
well as detailing some target specific installation instructions.

<p>GCC includes several components that previously were separate distributions
with their own installation instructions.  This document supersedes all 
package specific installation instructions.  We provide the component specific
installation information in the source distribution for historical reference
purposes only.

<p><em>Before</em> starting the build/install procedure please check
the <a href="specific.html">host/target specific installation notes</a>.
We recommend you browse the entire generic installation instructions
before you proceed.</p>

<p>The installation procedure itself is broken into five steps.

<ol>
  <li><a href="download.html">Downloading the source</a></li>
  <li><a href="configure.html">Configuration</a></li>
  <li><a href="build.html">Building</a></li>
  <li><a href="test.html">Testing</a> (optional)</li>
  <li><a href="finalinstall.html">Final install</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that GCC does not support <CODE>`make uninstall`</CODE>
and probably won't do so in the near future as this would open a can
of worms. Instead, we suggest that you install GCC into a directory of
its own and simply remove that directory when you do not need that
specific version of GCC any longer.
