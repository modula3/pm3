The installation instructions are no longer in this directory.  Instead
they can be found in the "install" directory at the toplevel of the GCC
distribution (ie gcc-2.95/install).  For HTML browsing start with
install/index.html, for plaintext, start with install/INDEX.

Moving the installation instructions in this manner makes it significantly
easier to share code between the distribution and the web pages.

This directory (INSTALL) will be completely removed in the next major
GCC release.
