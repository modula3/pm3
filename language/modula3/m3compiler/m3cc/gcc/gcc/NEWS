                                 GCC 2.95.3

   March 16, 2001

   The GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the
   release of GCC version 2.95.3. GCC used to stand for the GNU C
   Compiler, but since the compiler supports several other languages
   aside from C, it now stands for the GNU Compiler Collection.

   This is a minor release to address several bugs in the [1]GCC version
   2.95.2 release.

     * Generic bugfixes and improvements
          + Fix numerous problems that caused incorrect optimization in
            the register reloading code.
          + Fix numerous problems that caused incorrect optimization in
            the loop optimizer.
          + Fix aborts in the functions build_insn_chain and scan_loops
            under some circumstances.
          + Fix an alias analysis bug.
          + Fix an infinite compilation bug in the combiner.
          + A few problems with complex number support have been fixed.
          + It is no longer possible for gcc to act as a fork bomb when
            installed incorrectly.
          + The -fpack-struct option should be recognized now.
          + Fixed a bug that caused incorrect code to be generated due to
            a lost stack adjustment.
     * Platform specific bugfixes and improvements
          + Support building ARM toolchains hosted on Windows.
          + Fix attribute calculations in ARM toolchains.
          + arm-linux support has been improved.
          + Fix a PIC failure on sparc targets.
          + On ix86 targets, the regparm attribute should now work
            reliably.
          + Several updates for the h8300 port.

   The whole suite has been extensively [2]regression tested and
   [3]package tested. It should be reliable and suitable for widespread
   use.

   The GCC 2.95 release has several new optimizations, new targets, new
   languages and other new features as compared to EGCS 1.1 or GCC 2.8.
   See the [4]new features page for a more complete list of new features
   found in the GCC 2.95 releases.

   The sources include installation instructions in both HTML and
   plaintext forms in the install directory in the distribution. However,
   the most up to date [5]installation instructions and [6]build/test
   status are on the web pages. We will update those pages as new
   information becomes available.

   The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc to GCC. This
   [7]amazing group of volunteers is what makes GCC successful.

   And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
   [8]caveats to using GCC 2.95.3.

                                 GCC 2.95.2

   October 27, 1999

   The GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the
   release of GCC version 2.95.2. GCC used to stand for the GNU C
   Compiler, but since the compiler supports several other languages
   aside from C, it now stands for the GNU Compiler Collection.

   This is a minor release to address several bugs in the GCC version
   2.95.1 release.

   The -fstrict-aliasing is not enabled by default for GCC 2.95.2. While
   the optimizations performed by -fstrict-aliasing are valid according
   to the C and C++ standards, the optimization have caused some
   problems, particularly with old non-conforming code.

   The GCC developers are experimenting with ways to warn users about
   code which violates the C/C++ standards, but those warnings are not
   ready for widespread use at this time. Rather than wait for those
   warnings the GCC developers have chosen to disable -fstrict-aliasing
   by default for the GCC 2.95.2 release.

   We strongly encourage developers to find and fix code which violates
   the C/C++ standards as -fstrict-aliasing may be enabled by default in
   future releases. Use the option -fstrict-aliasing to re-enable these
   optimizations.

     * Generic bugfixes and improvements
          + Fix incorrectly optimized memory reference in global common
            subexpression elimination (GCSE) optimization pass.
          + Fix code generation bug in regmove.c in which it could
            incorrectly change a "const" value.
          + Fix bug in optimization of conditionals involving volatile
            memory references.
          + Avoid over-allocation of stack space for some procedures.
          + Fixed bug in the compiler which caused incorrect optimization
            of an obscure series of bit manipulations, shifts and
            arithmetic.
          + Fixed register allocator bug which caused teTeX to be
            mis-compiled on Sparc targets.
          + Avoid incorrect optimization of degenerate case statements
            for certain targets such as the ARM.
          + Fix out of range memory reference in the jump optimizer.
          + Avoid dereferencing null pointer in fix-header.
          + Fix test for GCC specific features so that it is possible to
            bootstrap with gcc-2.6.2 and older versions of GCC.
          + Fix typo in scheduler which could potentially cause out of
            range memory accesses.
          + Avoid incorrect loop reversal which caused incorrect code for
            certain loops on PowerPC targets.
          + Avoid incorrect optimization of switch statements on certain
            targets (for example the ARM).
     * Platform specific bugfixes and improvements
          + Work around bug in Sun V5.0 compilers which caused bootstrap
            comparison failures on Sparc targets.
          + Fix Sparc backend bug which caused aborts in final.c.
          + Fix sparc-hal-solaris2* configuration fragments.
          + Fix bug in sparc block profiling.
          + Fix obscure code generation bug for the PARISC targets.
          + Define __STDC_EXT__ for HPUX configurations.
          + Various POWERPC64 code generation bugfixes.
          + Fix abort for PPC targets using ELF (ex GNU/Linux).
          + Fix collect2 problems for AIX targets.
          + Correct handling of .file directive for PPC targets.
          + Fix bug in fix_trunc x86 patterns.
          + Fix x86 port to correctly pop the FP stack for functions that
            return structures in memory.
          + Fix minor bug in strlen x86 pattern.
          + Use stabs debugging instead of dwarf1 for x86-solaris
            targets.
          + Fix template repository code to handle leading underscore in
            mangled names.
          + Fix weak/weak alias support for OpenBSD.
          + GNU/Linux for the ARM has C++ compatible include files.
     * Language & Runtime specific fixes.
          + Fix handling of constructor attribute in the C front-end
            which caused problems building the Chill runtime library on
            some targets.
          + Fix minor problem merging type qualifiers in the C front-end.
          + Fix aliasing bug for pointers and references (C/C++).
          + Fix incorrect "non-constant initializer bug" when
            -traditional or -fwritable-strings is enabled.
          + Fix build error for Chill front-end on SunOS.
          + Do not complain about duplicate instantiations when using
            -frepo (C++)
          + Fix array bounds handling in C++ front-end which caused
            problems with dwarf debugging information in some
            circumstances.
          + Fix minor namespace problem.
          + Fix problem linking java programs.

   The whole suite has been extensively [1]regression tested and
   [2]package tested. It should be reliable and suitable for widespread
   use.

   The GCC 2.95 release has several new optimizations, new targets, new
   languages and other new features as compared to EGCS 1.1 or GCC 2.8.
   See the [3]new features page for a more complete list of new features

            aborts, core dumps or random parsing errors in the compiler.
          + Fix a couple bugs in the dwarf1 and dwarf2 debug record
            support.
          + Fix infinite loop in the CSE optimizer.
          + Avoid undefined behavior in compiler FP emulation code

http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/caveats.html

                              GCC 2.95 Caveats

     * GCC 2.95 will issue an error for invalid asm statements that had
       been silently accepted by earlier versions of the compiler. This
       is particularly noticeable when compiling older versions of the
       Linux kernel (2.0.xx). Please refer to the [1]FAQ for more
       information on this issue.
     * GCC 2.95 implements type based alias analysis to disambiguate
       memory references. Some programs, particularly the Linux kernel
       violate ANSI/ISO aliasing rules and therefore may not operate
       correctly when compiled with GCC 2.95. Please refer to the [2]FAQ
       for more information on this issue.
     * GCC 2.95 has a known bug in its handling of complex variables for
       64bit targets. Instead of silently generating incorrect code, GCC
       2.95 will issue a fatal error for situations it can not handle.
       This primarily affects the Fortran community as Fortran makes more
       use of complex variables than C or C++.
     * GCC 2.95 has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an
       integrated libg++. Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work
       with GCC 2.95. You can retrieve a recent copy of libg++ from the
       [3]GCC ftp server.
       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.
     * Exception handling may not work with shared libraries,
       particularly on alphas, hppas, rs6000/powerpc and mips based
       platforms. Exception handling is known to work on x86 GNU/Linux
       platforms with shared libraries.
     * In general, GCC 2.95 is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++
       code or deprecated C++ constructs than G++ 2.7, G++ 2.8, EGCS 1.0,
       or EGCS 1.1. As a result it may be necessary to fix C++ code
       before it will compile with GCC 2.95.
     * G++ is also converting toward the ISO C++ standard; as a result
       code which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other
       compilers and older versions of g++) may no longer be accepted.
       The flag -fpermissive may allow some non-conforming code to
       compile with GCC 2.95.
     * GCC 2.95 compiled C++ code is not binary compatible with EGCS
       1.1.x, EGCS 1.0.x or GCC 2.8.x.
     * GCC 2.95 does not have changes from the GCC 2.8 tree that were
       made between Sept 30, 1998 and April 30, 1999 (the official end of
       the GCC 2.8 project). Future GCC releases will include all the
       changes from the defunct GCC 2.8 sources.

                                 EGCS 1.1.2

   March 15, 1999

   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.1.2.

   EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers
   using an open development model to accelerate development and testing
   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.

   EGCS 1.1.2 is a minor update to the EGCS 1.1.1 compiler to fix several
   serious problems in EGCS 1.1.1.
     * General improvements and fixes
          + Fix bug in loop optimizer which caused the SPARC (and
            potentially other) ports to segfault.
          + Fix infinite recursion in alias analysis and combiner code.
          + Fix bug in regclass preferencing.
          + Fix incorrect loop reversal which caused incorrect code to be
            generated for several targets.
          + Fix return value for builtin memcpy.
          + Reduce compile time for certain loops which exposed quadratic
            behavior in the loop optimizer.
          + Fix bug which caused volatile memory to be written multiple
            times when only one write was needed/desired.
          + Fix compiler abort in caller-save.c
          + Fix combiner bug which caused incorrect code generation for
            certain division by constant operations.
          + Fix incorrect code generation due to a bug in range check
            optimizations.
          + Fix incorrect code generation due to mis-handling of
            clobbered values in CSE.
          + Fix compiler abort/segfault due to incorrect register
            splitting when unrolling loops.
          + Fix code generation involving autoincremented addresses with
            ternary operators.
          + Work around bug in the scheduler which caused qt to be
            mis-compiled on some platforms.
          + Fix code generation problems with -fshort-enums.
          + Tighten security for temporary files.
          + Improve compile time for codes which make heavy use of
            overloaded functions.
          + Fix multiply defined constructor/destructor symbol problems.
          + Avoid setting bogus RPATH environemnt variable during
            bootstrap.
          + Avoid GNU-make dependencies in the texinfo subdir.
          + Install CPP wrapper script in $(prefix)/bin if --enable-cpp.
            --enable-cpp= can be used to specify an additional install
            directory for the cpp wrapper script.
          + Fix CSE bug which caused incorrect label-label refs to appear
            on some platforms.
          + Avoid linking in EH routines from libgcc if they are not
            needed.
          + Avoid obscure bug in aliasing code.
          + Fix bug in weak symbol handling.
     * Platform-specific improvements and fixes
          + Fix detection of PPro/PII on Unixware 7.
          + Fix compiler segfault when building spec99 and other programs
            for SPARC targets.
          + Fix code-generation bugs for integer and floating point
            conditional move instructions on the PPro/PII.
          + Use fixincludes to fix byteorder problems on i?86-*-sysv.
          + Fix build failure for the arc port.
          + Fix floating point format configuration for i?86-gnu port
          + Fix problems with hppa1.0-hp-hpux10.20 configuration when
            threads are enabled
          + Fix coldfire code generation bugs.
          + Fix "unrecognized insn" problems for Alpha and PPC ports.
          + Fix h8/300 code generation problem with floating point values
            in memory.
          + Fix unrecognized insn problems for the m68k port.
          + Fix namespace-pollution problem for the x86 port.
          + Fix problems with old assembler on x86 NeXT systems.
          + Fix PIC code-generation problems for the SPARC port.
          + Fix minor bug with LONG_CALLS in PowerPC SVR4 support.
          + Fix minor ISO namespace violation in Alpha varargs/stdarg
            support.
          + Fix incorrect "braf" instruction usage for the SH port.
          + Fix minor bug in va-sh which prevented its use with -ansi.
          + Fix problems recognizing and supporting FreeBSD.
          + Handle OpenBSD systems correctly.
          + Minor fixincludes fix for Digital UNIX 4.0B.
          + Fix problems with ctors/dtors in SCO shared libraries.
          + Abort instead of generating incorrect code for PPro/PII
            floating point conditional moves.
          + Avoid multiply defined symbols on Linux/GNU systems using
            libc-5.4.xx.
          + Fix abort in alpha compiler.

     Fortran-specific fixes
     * Fix the IDate intrinsic (VXT) (in libg2c) so the returned year is
       in the documented, non-Y2K-compliant range of 0-99, instead of
       being returned as 100 in the year 2000.
     * Fix the `Date_and_Time' intrinsic (in libg2c) to return the
       milliseconds value properly in Values(8).
     * Fix the `LStat' intrinsic (in libg2c) to return device-ID
       information properly in SArray(7).

   An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of new
   features and optimizations which are still under development. However,
   EGCS has been carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to
   most gcc releases.

   EGCS 1.1.2 is based on the June 6, 1998 snapshot of the GCC 2.8
   development sources; it contains all of the new features found in GCC
   2.8.1 as well as all new development from gcc2 up to June 6, 1998.

   See the [1]new features page for a more complete list of new features
   found in EGCS 1.1 releases.

   The EGCS 1.1.2 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
   and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel
   directory of the EGCS 1.1.2 distribution). However, we also keep the
   most up to date [2]installation instructions and [3]build/test status
   on our web page. We will update those pages as new information becomes
   available.

   The EGCS project would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc. This [4]amazing
   group of volunteers is what makes EGCS successful.

   And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
   [5]caveats to using EGCS 1.1.2. [6]Download EGCS 1.1.2 from
   egcs.cygnus.com (USA California) -->

                                  EGCS 1.1

   September 3, 1998

   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.1.

   EGCS is a free software project to further the development of the GNU
   compilers using an open development environment.

   EGCS 1.1 is a major new release of the EGCS compiler system. It has
   been [1]extensively tested and is believed to be stable and suitable
   for widespread use.

   EGCS 1.1 is based on an June 6, 1998 snapshot of the GCC 2.8
   development sources; it contains all of the new features found in GCC
   2.8.1 as well as all new development from GCC up to June 6, 1998.

   EGCS also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC or
   in older versions of EGCS.
     * Global common subexpression elimination and global constant/copy
       propagation (aka [2]gcse)
     * Ongoing improvements to the [3]alias analysis support to allow for
       better optimizations throughout the compiler.
     * Vastly improved [4]C++ compiler and integrated C++ runtime
       libraries.
     * Fixes for the /tmp symlink race security problems.
     * New targets including mips16, arm-thumb and 64 bit PowerPC.
     * Improvements to GNU Fortran (g77) compiler and runtime library
       made since [5]g77 version 0.5.23.

   See the [6]new features page for a more complete list of new features
   found in EGCS 1.1 releases.

   The EGCS 1.1 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
   and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel
   directory of the EGCS 1.1 distribution). However, we also keep the
   most up to date [7]installation instructions and [8]build/test status
   on our web page. We will update those pages as new information becomes
   available.

   The EGCS project would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc. This [9]amazing

http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.1/features.html

                           EGCS 1.1 new features

     * Integrated GNU Fortran (g77) compiler and runtime library with
       improvements, based on [1]g77 version 0.5.23.
     * Vast improvements in the C++ compiler; so many they have [2]page
       of their own!
     * Compiler implements [3]global common subexpression elimination and
       global copy/constant propagation.
     * More major improvements in the [4]alias analysis code.
     * More major improvements in the exception handling code to improve
       performance, lower static overhead and provide the infrastructure
       for future improvements.
     * The infamous /tmp symlink race security problems have been fixed.
     * The regmove optimization pass has been nearly completely rewritten
       to improve performance of generated code.
     * The compiler now recomputes register usage information before
       local register allocation. By providing more accurate information
       to the priority based allocator, we get better register
       allocation.
     * The register reloading phase of the compiler optimizes spill code
       much better than in previous releases.
     * Some bad interactions between the register allocator and
       instruction scheduler have been fixed, resulting in much better
       code for certain programs. Additionally, we have tuned the
       scheduler in various ways to improve performance of generated code
       for some architectures.
     * The compiler's branch shortening algorithms have been
       significantly improved to work better on targets which align jump
       targets.
     * The compiler now supports -Os to prefer optimizing for code space
       over optimizing for code speed.
     * The compiler will now totally eliminate library calls which
       compute constant values. This primarily helps targets with no
       integer div/mul support and targets without floating point
       support.
     * The compiler now supports an extensive "--help" option.
     * cpplib has been greatly improved and may be suitable for limited
       use.
     * Memory footprint for the compiler has been significantly reduced
       for some pathological cases.
     * The time to build EGCS has been improved for certain targets
       (particularly the alpha and mips platforms).
     * Many infrastructure improvements throughout the compiler, plus the
       usual mountain of bugfixes and minor improvements.
     * Target dependent improvements:
          + SPARC port now includes V8 plus and V9 support as well as
            performance tuning for Ultra class machines. The SPARC port
            now uses the Haifa scheduler.
          + Alpha port has been tuned for the EV6 processor and has an
            optimized expansion of memcpy/bzero. The Alpha port now uses
            the Haifa scheduler.
          + RS6000/PowerPC: EGCS 1.1 includes support for the Power64
            architecture and aix4.3 support. The RS6000/PowerPC port now
            uses the Haifa scheduler.
          + x86: Alignment of static store data and jump targets is per
            Intel recommendations now. Various improvements throughout
            the x86 port to improve performance on Pentium processors.
            Conditional move support has been fixed and enabled for PPro
            processors. The x86 port also better supports 64bit
            operations now.
          + MIPS has improved multiply/multiply-add support and now
            includes mips16 ISA support.
          + M68k has many micro-optimizations and Coldfire fixes.
     * Core compiler is based on the GCC development tree from June 9,
       1998, so we have all of the [5]features found in GCC 2.8.

                              EGCS 1.1 Caveats

     * EGCS has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an integrated
       libg++. Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work with EGCS;
       HJ Lu has made a [1]libg++ snapshot available which may work with
       EGCS.
       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.
     * Exception handling may not work with shared libraries,
       particularly on alphas, hppas, rs6000/powerpc and mips based
       platforms. Exception handling is known to work on x86-linux
       platforms with shared libraries.
     * Some versions of the Linux kernel have bugs which prevent them
       from being compiled or from running when compiled by EGCS. See
       [2]the FAQ for additional information.
     * In general, EGCS is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++ code
       or deprecated C++ constructs than g++-2.7, g++-2.8 or EGCS 1.0. As
       a result it may be necessary to fix C++ code before it will
       compile with EGCS.
     * G++ is also converting toward the ISO C++ standard; as a result
       code which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other
       compilers and older versions of g++) may no longer be accepted.
     * EGCS 1.1 compiled C++ code is not binary compatible with EGCS
       1.0.x or GCC 2.8.x due to changes necessary to support thread safe
       exception handling.

                                 EGCS 1.0.3

   May 15, 1998

   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.3.

   EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers
   using an open development model to accelerate development and testing
   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.

   EGCS 1.0.3 is a minor update to the EGCS 1.0.2 compiler to fix a few
   problems reported by Red Hat for builds of Red Hat 5.1.
     * Generic bugfixes:
          + Fix a typo in the libio library which resulted in incorrect
            behavior of istream::get.
          + Fix the Fortran negative array index problem.
          + Fix a major problem with the ObjC runtime thread support
            exposed by glibc2.
          + Reduce memory consumption of the Haifa scheduler.
     * Target specific bugfixes:
          + Fix one x86 floating point code generation bug exposed by
            glibc2 builds.
          + Fix one x86 internal compiler error exposed by glibc2 builds.
          + Fix profiling bugs on the Alpha.
          + Fix ImageMagick & emacs 20.2 build problems on the Alpha.
          + Fix rs6000/ppc bug when converting values from integer types
            to floating point types.

   An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of new
   features and optimizations which are still under development. However,
   EGCS has been carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to
   most GCC releases.

   EGCS 1.0.3 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the GCC 2.8
   development sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found
   in GCC 2.8.

   EGCS also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC 2.7
   or GCC 2.8.
     * Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
       GNU/Linux systems!
     * The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of
       [1]SGI's STL release instead of a modified copy.
     * Integrated GNU Fortran compiler
     * New instruction scheduler
     * New alias analysis code

   See the [2]new features page for a more complete list of new features
   found in EGCS 1.0.x releases.

   The EGCS 1.0.3 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
   and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel
   directory of the EGCS 1.0.3 distribution). However, we also keep the
   most up to date [3]installation instructions and [4]build/test status
   on our web page. We will update those pages as new information becomes
   available.

   And, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some [5]caveats to
   using EGCS.

   Update: Big thanks to Stanford for providing a high speed link for
   downloading EGCS (go.cygnus.com)!

   We'd like to thank the numerous people that have contributed new
   features, test results, bugfixes, etc. Unfortunately, they're far too
   numerous to mention by name.

                                 EGCS 1.0.1

   January 6, 1998

   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.1.

   EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers
   using an open development model to accelerate development and testing
   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.

   EGCS 1.0.1 is a minor update to the EGCS 1.0 compiler to fix a few
   critical bugs and add support for Red Hat 5.0 Linux. Changes since the
   EGCS 1.0 release:
     * Add support for Red Hat 5.0 Linux and better support for Linux
       systems using glibc2.
       Many programs failed to link when compiled with EGCS 1.0 on Red
       Hat 5.0 or on systems with newer versions of glibc2. EGCS 1.0.1
       should fix these problems.
     * Compatability with both EGCS 1.0 and GCC 2.8 libgcc exception
       handling interfaces.
       To avoid future compatibility problems, we strongly urge anyone
       who is planning on distributing shared libraries that contain C++
       code to upgrade to EGCS 1.0.1 first.
       Soon after EGCS 1.0 was released, the GCC developers made some
       incompatible changes in libgcc's exception handling interfaces.
       These changes were needed to solve problems on some platforms.
       This means that GCC 2.8.0, when released, will not be seamlessly
       compatible with shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0. The reason is
       that the libgcc.a in GCC 2.8.0 will not contain a function needed
       by the old interface.
       The result of this is that there may be compatibility problems
       with shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0 when used with GCC 2.8.0.
       With EGCS 1.0.1, generated code uses the new (GCC 2.8.0)
       interface, and libgcc.a has the support routines for both the old
       and the new interfaces (so EGCS 1.0.1 and EGCS 1.0 code can be
       freely mixed, and EGCS 1.0.1 and GCC 2.8.0 code can be freely
       mixed).
       The maintainers of GCC 2.x have decided against including seamless
       support for the old interface in 2.8.0, since it was never
       "official", so to avoid future compatibility problems we recommend
       against distributing any shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0 that
       contain C++ code (upgrade to 1.0.1 and use that).
     * Various bugfixes in the x86, hppa, mips, and rs6000/ppc backends.
       The x86 changes fix code generation errors exposed when building
       glibc2 and the Linux dynamic linker (ld.so).
       The hppa change fixes a compiler abort when configured for use
       with RTEMS.
       The MIPS changes fix problems with the definition of LONG_MAX on
       newer systems, allow for command line selection of the target ABI,
       and fix one code generation problem.
       The rs6000/ppc change fixes some problems with passing structures
       to varargs/stdarg functions.
     * A few machine independent bugfixes, mostly to fix code generation
       errors when building Linux kernels or glibc.
     * Fix a few critical exception handling and template bugs in the C++
       compiler.
     * Fix Fortran namelist bug on alphas.
     * Fix build problems on x86-solaris systems.

   An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of new
   features and optimizations which are still under development. However,
   EGCS has been carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to
   most GCC releases.

   EGCS 1.0.1 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the GCC 2.8
   development sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found
   in GCC 2.8.

   EGCS also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC 2.7
   and even the soon to be released GCC 2.8 compilers.
     * Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
       linux systems!
     * The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of
       [1]SGI's STL release.

     * New instruction scheduler
     * New alias analysis code

   See the [2]new features page for a more complete list of new features
   found in EGCS 1.0.x releases.

   December 3, 1997

   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.

   EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers
   using an open development model to accelerate development and testing
   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.

   An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of

     * Integrated GNU Fortran compiler based on g77-0.5.22-19970929.
     * Vast improvements in the C++ compiler; so many they have [2]page
       of their own!
     * Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
       linux systems!
     * New instruction scheduler from IBM Haifa which includes support
       for function wide instruction scheduling as well as superscalar
       scheduling.
     * Significantly improved alias analysis code.
     * Improved register allocation for two address machines.
     * Significant code generation improvements for Fortran code on
       Alphas
     * Various optimizations from the g77 project as well as improved
       loop optimizations.
     * Dwarf2 debug format support for some targets.
     * egcs libstdc++ includes the SGI STL implementation without
       changes.
     * As a result of these and other changes, egcs libstc++ is not
       binary compatible with previous releases of libstdc++.
     * Various new ports -- UltraSPARC, Irix6.2 & Irix6.3 support, The
       SCO Openserver 5 family (5.0.{0,2,4} and Internet FastStart 1.0
       and 1.1), Support for RTEMS on several embedded targets, Support
       for arm-linux, Mitsubishi M32R, Hitachi H8/S, Matsushita MN102 and
       MN103, NEC V850, Sparclet, Solaris & Linux on PowerPCs, etc.
     * Integrated testsuites for gcc, g++, g77, libstdc++ and libio.
     * RS6000/PowerPC ports generate code which can run on all
       RS6000/PowerPC variants by default.
     * -mcpu= and -march= switches for the x86 port to allow better
       control over how the x86 port generates code.
     * Includes the template repository patch (aka repo patch); note the
       new template code makes repo obsolete for ELF systems using gnu-ld
       such as Linux.
     * Plus the usual assortment of bugfixes and improvements.

                              EGCS 1.0 Caveats

     * EGCS has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an integrated
       libg++. Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work with egc; HJ
       Lu has made a [1]libg++ snapshot available which may work with
       EGCS.
       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.
     * Note that using -pedantic or -Wreturn-type can cause an explosion
       in the amount of memory needed for template-heavy C++ code, such
       as code that uses STL. Also note that -Wall includes
       -Wreturn-type, so if you use -Wall you will need to specify
       -Wno-return-type to turn it off.
     * Exception handling may not work with shared libraries,
       particularly on alphas, hppas, and mips based platforms. Exception
       handling is known to work on x86-linux platforms with shared
       libraries.
     * Some versions of the Linux kernel have bugs which prevent them
       from being compiled or from running when compiled by EGCS. See
       [2]the FAQ for additional information.
     * In general, EGCS is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++ code
       or deprecated C++ constructs than G++ 2.7. As a result it may be
       necessary to fix C++ code before it will compile with EGCS.
     * G++ is also aggressively tracking the C++ standard; as a result
       code which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other
       compilers and older versions of G++) may no longer be accepted.
     * EGCS 1.0 may not work with Red Hat Linux 5.0 on all targets. EGCS
       1.0.x and later releases should work with Red Hat Linux 5.0.
