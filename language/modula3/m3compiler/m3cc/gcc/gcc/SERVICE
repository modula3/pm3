GNU Service Directory
---------------------

This is a list of people who have asked to be listed as offering
support services for GNU software, including GNU Emacs, for a fee
or in some cases at no charge.

The information comes from the people who asked to be listed;
we do not include any information we know to be false, but we
cannot check out any of the information; we are transmitting it to
you as it was given to us and do not promise it is correct.
Also, this is not an endorsement of the people listed here.
We have no opinions and usually no information about the abilities of
any specific person.  We provide this list to enable you to contact
service providers and decide for yourself whether to hire one.

Before FSF will list your name in the GNU Service Directory, we ask
that you agree informally to the following terms:

1. You will not restrict (except by copyleft) the use or distribution
of any software, documentation, or other information you supply anyone
in the course of modifying, extending, or supporting GNU software.
This includes any information specifically designed to ameliorate the
use of GNU software.

2. You will not take advantage of contact made through the Service
Directory to advertise an unrelated business (e.g., sales of
non-GNU-related proprietary information).  You may spontaneously
mention your availability for general consulting, but you should not
promote a specific unrelated business unless the client asks.

Please include some indication of your rates, because otherwise users
have nothing to go by.	Please put each e-mail address inside "<>".
Please put nothing else inside "<>".  Thanks!

For a current copy of this directory, or to have yourself listed, ask:

Altrasoft provides corporate-quality support, development and user

information management and software development toolset built atop emacs,
written by one of our associates.)  Emacs distributions for a variety of
platforms are also available, as is support for other emacs variants, such as
those often found on PCs.

Our unique focus on emacs-related work allows us to attract expert talent in
this area to keep you on the leading edge of productivity, especially if you
do software development work.  We do the porting, patching, coding,
integrating, debugging, documenting and testing so that your people spend
much more productive time on their mainline tasks.

Standard support packages include help on all aspects of the packages
supported, including all tools shipped as a standard part of the original
package distribution.  In general, we want to give you an unbelievably strong
level of support, so where we can, we will also answer questions concerning
any add-on Lisp code that is used at your site.  Setup and customization
help, bug fixes, and announcements of new releases are, of course, included.

Support rates start at $1,500 USD, for single user support for one year.
Discounts are available for group contracts.  We also offer Golden Support
contracts for those who need the absolute best in mission-critical support;
contact us for details.  Hourly development rates and fixed bid work are
available.
