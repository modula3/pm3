<H1>A tour of the compiler internals</H1>
<P>

This section contains a brief introduction to the internal structure
of the compiler.  This introduction is neither
comprehensive nor tutorial; it is merely intended as a stepping stone
for the courageous.
<P>

The compiler has undergone much evolution.  It started as a project to
build a simple and easy to maintain compiler.  Somewhere along the way
we decided to compile Modula-3.  Much later we decided to generate C.
Now it generates native code directly.
<P>

The initial observation was that most compilers' data structures were
visible and complex.  This situation makes it necessary to understand
a compiler in its entirety before attempting non-trivial enhancements
or bug fixes.  By keeping most of the compiler's primary data
structures hidden behind opaque interfaces, we hoped to avoid this
pitfall.  So far, bugs have been easy to find.  During early
development, it was relatively easy to track the weekly language
changes.
<P>

The compiler is decomposed by language feature rather than the more
traditional compiler passes.  We attempted to confine each language
feature to a single module.  For example, the parsing, name binding,
type checking and code production for each statement is in its own
module.  This separation means that only the <TT>CaseStmt</TT> module
needs to know what data structures exist to implement
<TT>CASE</TT> statements.
Other parts of the compiler need only know that the <TT>CASE</TT>
statement is a statement.  This fact is captured by the object subtype
hierarchy.  A <TT>CaseStmt.T</TT> is a subtype of a <TT>Stmt.T</TT>.
<P>

The main object types within the compiler are: values, statements,
expressions, and types.  ``Values'' is a misnomer; ``bindings'' would
be better.  This object class include anything that can be named:
modules, procedures, variables, exceptions, constants, types,
enumeration elements, record fields, methods, and procedure formals.
Statements include all of the Modula-3 statements.  Expressions include
all the Modula-3 expression forms that have a special syntax.  And
finally, types include the Modula-3 types.
<P>

The compiler retains the traditional separation
of input streams, scanner, symbol table, and output stream.
<P>

The compilation process retains the usual phases.  Symbols are scanned
as needed by the parser.  A recursive descent parser reads the entire
source and builds the internal syntax tree.  All remaining passes
simply add decorations to this tree.  The next phase binds all
identifiers to values in scopes.
Modula-3 allows arbitrary forward references so it is necessary
to accumulate all names within a scope before binding any identifiers
to values.  The next phase divides the types into structurally
equivalent classes.  This phase actually occurs in two steps.  First,
the types are divided into classes such that each class will have a
unique C representation.  Then, those classes are refined into what
Modula-3 defines as structurally equivalent types.  After the types
have been partitioned, the entire tree is checked for type errors.
Finally, the IL is emitted.
<P>

The intermediate language is defined as a sequence of calls on an
<TT>M3CG.T</TT> object.  In the compiler front end there is a thin
veneer interface, <TT>CG</TT>, that makes the actual calls.  The veneer
converts between the bit-level addressing used in the front end
and the byte-level addressing used by the back ends.  There are
several implementations of <TT>M3CG.T</TT>.  The one that we
currently use is <TT>M3CG_Wr</TT>.  It converts the stream of
calls into a parseable stream of ASCII characters.
<P>

The current back end is constructed as <TT>gcc</TT> front end.
It reads the <TT>M3CG</TT> output of the front end and produces
the tree structures needed by <TT>gcc</TT>'s back end.
<P>

The front end is in the <TT>compiler</TT> package.
Within that package the following directories exist:
<PRE>
    builtinOps    ABS, ADR, BITSIZE, ...
    builtinTypes  INTEGER, CHAR, REFANY, ...
    builtinWord   Word.And, Word.Or, ...
    exprs         +, -, [], ^, AND, OR, ...
    main          main program
    misc          scanner, symbol tables, ...
    stmts         :=, IF, TRY, WHILE, ...
    types         ARRAY, BITS FOR, RECORD, ...
    values        MODULE, PROCEDURE, VAR, ...
</PRE>
<P>

The intermediate language is in the <TT>m3cg</TT> package.
<P>

The back end is in the <TT>m3cc</TT> package.  The single file that
implements the <TT>M3CG</TT> reader is <TT>gcc/m3.c</TT>.
<P>

<H2>Linking</H2>

<P>
SRC Modula-3 uses a special two-phase linker.
The first phase of the linker checks that all version stamps are
consistent. It then generates in <I>m3main</I>
declarations for the runtime type structures,
and initialization code for the collection of objects to be linked.  
The second phases calls the host
system's linker to actually link the program.
<P>
The information needed by the first phase is generated by the compiler
in a file ending in <TT>.m3x</TT>.
For every symbol <TT>X.Z</TT> exported or imported by a module, the
compiler generates a version stamp.
These stamps are used to ensure that
all modules linked into a single program agree on the type of <TT>X.Z</TT>.
The linker will refuse to link programs with inconsistent
version stamps.

<H2>File extensions</H2>
<P>
SRC Modula-3 uses files with the following customizable suffixes:

<DL>
<DT>.i3 (.m3)<DD>Modula-3 interface (module) sources.
<DT>.ig (.mg)<DD>generic interface (module) sources.
<DT>.ic (.mc)<DD><TT>M3CG</TT> intermediate language files.
<DT>.is (.ms)<DD>intermediate assembly files.
<DT>.io (.mo)<DD>object files.
<DT>.c<DD>C source files.
<DT>.h<DD>C header files.
<DT>.s<DD>foreign assembly source files.
<DT>.o<DD>foreign object files.
<DT>.a<DD>library archives.
<DT>.m3x<DD>pre-linker information including version stamps.
