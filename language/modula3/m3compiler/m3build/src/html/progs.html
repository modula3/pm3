<DL>
<DT>library(X)<DD>
          compile the sources and build a
          library, <TT>X</TT>, from the resulting compiled object files.
          The visibility of the library is hidden.
 

<DT>Library(X)<DD>
          The same as <TT>library</TT>, but <TT>X</TT> is exported.
 

<DT>program(X)<DD>
          constructs an executable program named <TT>X</TT> from the given
          sources.
 
<DT>Program(X)<DD>  
          like <TT>program</TT>, but <TT>X</TT> is exported to <TT>/bin</TT>.
 

<DT>OtherPackage(X)<DD>
    processes the m3makefile but without producing a program or library.
    This is typically used for packages containing only documentation.
