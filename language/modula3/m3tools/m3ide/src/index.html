<H1>M3IDE a simple environment for M3 development</H1>
<P>
M3ide runs under xemacs or emacs and may be used to perform all the
commonly needed operations for developing Modula-3 programs.
<P>
It can be used to call m3build, m3ship, m3pp, m3gdb, m3browser,
see documentation files, analyze_coverage and gprof. M3build is
called on the right package based on the currently edited file
and uses the right options if coverage or profiling is requested.
When the program is run, an emacs shell window is opened and the
correct executable is called, if coverage/profiling is required,
and may be specified to run with shownew, showheap and showthreads.
FormsVBT forms may be shown, somewhat like in formsedit.
<P>
The first step is set your emacs path to include
/usr/local/pm3-1.1/lib/elisp and
to load m3setup.el from your .emacs file.

<PRE><TT>
(setq load-path (append (list "/usr/local/pm3-1.1/lib/elisp") load-path))
(load-library "m3setup.el")
</TT></PRE>
<P>
This will setup the automatic loading of the m3ide (within the modula3)
mode when a file ending in .i3, .m3, .ig, .mg, .fv is loaded. Then,
upon need, the m3ide and the m3browser executables will be
started as child processes of xemacs and communicate through
pipe (m3ide) and sockets (m3browser). By default, m3browser will
not accept requests from other hosts but will accept requests from
other users on the same host, thus making your source code, along
the paths listed in the emacs variable m3-source-roots, available
to anyone with access to your host.
<P>
Starting the m3ide takes some time. Starting m3browser, depending
on the packages scanned, may take a relatively long time. Dont
be surprised by the delays encountered when they are started,
the first time a command using them is used. When you add or remove
profiling and coverage options, the current object files should be
removed to force recompilation.
<P>
If you do not have w3.el, you can simply remove the corresponding
load-library call.
<P>
I am quite happy with the functionality available with this simple
environment. However, i am not happy with the speed of xemacs and
the W3 mode in particular. Furthermore, emacs lisp is not
multi-threaded which makes asynchronous communication with child
processes difficult and at times unreliable, at least for a relatively 
neophyte lisp programmer like myself.
<P>
I already implemented in a separate Modula-3 executable (m3ide)
a number of things which could have been done in emacs lisp.
Other things like showing a FormsVBT form needed a separate
executable anyway. In the longer term, it could be interesting to
move even more functionality into Modula-3 code. Here is a whish
list. I will not have time in the foreseeable future to do
any of it. Volunteers are more than welcome. Thanks to
Lennart Staflin &lt;lenst@lysator.liu.se&gt; for converting the xemacs menus
to emacs and miscellaneous elisp code improvements.

<UL>
<LI> Replace the W3 mode by WebScape (modula-3 Web client).
<LI> Change the communication between the Web client and m3browser
     to use a pipe or to send a long identification string in order
     to prevent other users on the same host to access your source
     code (useful for class assignments on shared lab hosts...).
<LI> Make m3browser a library component and integrate in a single
     process m3ide, WebScape and m3browser. Add functionality to
     m3browser to serve other files and run cgi scripts (full text
     search on the M3 documentation).
<LI> Implement emacs-like buffers in Modula-3 and replace emacs with a 
     Trestle/FormsVBT editor customizable with Obliq or an 
     interpreted/dynamically-loaded Modula-3 subset.
