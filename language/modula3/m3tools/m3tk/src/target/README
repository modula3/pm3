This package implements the M3CBackEnd interface of the Modula-3 toolkit
compiler front-end. It claims to match the SRC Modula-3 implementation,
e.g. it computes the same value of BYTESIZE(T) as the SRC compiler.
It is parameterised by machine type (actually C compiler) and it is
possible to change this default at compile time. 

Some interfaces may be useful to other AST tools, vis:

M3CBackEnd_C    Reveals an M3AST_SM.Exp_value
M3CBE_C_Tool    Handles the decoding of the machine type setting
