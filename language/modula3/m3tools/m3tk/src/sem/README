This package contains the Modula-3 toolkit semantic analyser. As well
as checking the static semantics, it also computes the semantic
AST attributes specified in the M3AST_SM interface (in the m3tk-ast)
package. Most of this package is private, but some interfaces provide
utility code that is needed by many AST clients, vis:

M3ASTNext       Provides some iterators to "smooth out" the structure
                of the AST. E.g the sequence of "Used_interface_id" nodes
                from all of the "IMPORT", "FROM I IMPORT" nodes.
M3CTypesMisc    Useful operations on M3TYPE, TYPE_SPEC classes.
M3CStdProcs     Support for the "standard" procedures/functions
M3CStdTypes     Support for the built-in types, e.g. "BOOLEAN".

M3CBackEnd      Defines the interface between the front-end and
                the back end, in terms of a set of procedures
                that must be implemented.
