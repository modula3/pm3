This package contains the guts of the "m3check" tool. It started life
as a simple "dependency analyser", hence the term "dep" but has evolved
into providing support for the compilation of large systems. In
general, if you want to write a tool that is going to access entire
programs or packages as AST collections, you will find this package
useful.
