<H1>GNU emacs support</H1>
<P>

SRC Modula-3 comes with a mode for editing Modula-3 programs under
<TT>gnuemacs</TT>.  Here is a list of the main features this mode
provides:

<UL>
<LI> Indenting/pretty-printing
<P>

Modula-3 mode provides two methods of formatting code, one ``batch''
and one ``interactive.'' The batch method invokes the program <A
HREF="pprint.html"><TT>m3pp</TT></A>, which takes a program unit such
as a procedure and formats it completely. The <TT>gnuemacs</TT>
commands (and their keyboard shortcuts) that invoke <A
HREF="../../pp/src"><TT>m3pp</TT></A> are: <P> <DL> <DT> <TT>M-x
m3::pp-buffer</TT> (C-c b) <DD> Pretty prints the current buffer. <P>
<DT> <TT>M-x m3::pp-region</TT> (C-c r) <DD> Pretty-prints the code
between mark and point. <P> <DT> <TT>M-x m3::pp-unit</TT> (C-c u) <DD>
Pretty-prints the ``unit'' containing the cursor. (A unit is a
top-level construct such as <TT>CONST</TT>, <TT>TYPE</TT>,
<TT>VAR</TT>, or <TT>PROCEDURE</TT>.) </DL> <P>

The other method of formatting text is a more traditional one for
<TT>gnuemacs</TT>, in which the language mode provides a key that
indents the current line appropriately.  In keeping with the
convention used in modes for other languages such as Lisp and C, the
key used is <TT>TAB</TT>.  Typing <TT>TAB</TT> on a line indents the
current line in a way that is (we hope) appropriate given the lines
that precede it.
<P>

The two formatting methods are not mutually exclusive; perhaps
you like the way <TT>m3pp</TT> lines up columns in declarations,
but you also like to keep things indented while you type.  You
can use the electric mode to get things close, then invoke
<A HREF="pprint.html"><TT>m3pp</TT></A> when you're done. 
<P>

<LI> Avoidance of typing
<P>

Modula-3 mode offers some aid if you don't like typing a lot of
uppercase keywords.  The <TT>TAB</TT> actually serves double
duty; it not only indents the current line, but when invoked at
the end of a word, it attempts to complete the current word as a
keyword.  For example <TT>b TAB</TT> expands the <TT>b</TT> to
<TT>BEGIN</TT>, provided the <TT>b</TT> appears in a context where 
<TT>BEGIN</TT> may be a valid keyword.  There are some fairly extensive
rules governing the contexts in which a given keyword is a valid
completion; the net result is that it is seldom necessary to type
more than one letter to get the correct completion.  If you
specify a non-unique prefix of a set of keywords, it chooses the
first in an ordering intended to capture frequency of use; it
also presents the other choices, and typing <TT>TAB</TT> repeatedly
cycles through these choices.
<P>

A pair of related features are ``<TT>END</TT>-completion'' and
``<TT>END</TT>-matching.''  If the elisp variable
<TT>m3::electric-end</TT> is set to <TT>'all</TT>, completing the
keyword <TT>END</TT> has the additional effect of finding the
construct that the <TT>END</TT> completes.  If that construct is a
an interface, module, or procedure, it fills in the name of the
completed construct after the <TT>END</TT>; otherwise, it inserts a
comment containing the keyword of the completed construct.  If
<TT>m3::electric-end</TT> is <TT>'proc-mod</TT>, it only fills in
real names, never keyword comments.  Independently, a non-<TT>nil</TT>
value of the elisp variable <TT>m3::blink-end-matchers</TT> causes
completion of <TT>END</TT> to blink the cursor briefly at the
beginning of the completed construct.
<P>

<LI> Finding files
<P>

The key <TT>C-c i</TT> is bound to <TT>m3::show-interface</TT>, which
expects the point to be in an interface name, and attempts to
find that interface and display it in another window.
It uses a built-in list of directories.  The
default value of this list is the one used at SRC; other
sites will probably need to modify this.
<P>

The key <TT>C-c m</TT> is bound to <TT>m3::show-implementation</TT>.  This
attempts to find the module that implements the interface in the
current buffer.  As distributed, this function relies on SRC-specific
conventions. Obviously, this may not work outside of SRC, and
<TT>m3::show-implementation</TT> may need to be re-implemented or abandoned.
</UL>
<P>

To have the Modula-3 mode automatically invoked when visiting a
Modula-3 source file, you should put in your <TT>.emacs</TT>:
<P>

<PRE>
    (autoload 'modula-3-mode "modula3")
    (setq auto-mode-alist 
         (append '(("\\.ig$" . modula-3-mode)
                   ("\\.mg$" . modula-3-mode)
                   ("\\.i3$" . modula-3-mode)
                   ("\\.m3$" . modula-3-mode))
                   auto-mode-alist))	
</PRE>
<P>

It is also convenient to have the lines:
<PRE>
    (setq completion-ignored-extensions
       (append '(".mo" ".mx" ".mc" ".io" ".ix") completion-ignored-extensions))
</PRE>
so that you don't get the files with those extensions offered as
possible completions.
<P>

Your system administrator may have inserted these lines in the default
macro files for your system.
<P>

<H2>Tags</H2>
<P>

There is also a program to build tags file for Modula-3 programs:
<TT>m3tags</TT>; see the manpage for the details.  When the system is
installed, a tag file for the public interfaces is built.  To access
it, you need in your <TT>.emacs</TT> (or in the system initialization file)
the line:
<PRE>
    (visit-tags-table "LIB_USE/FTAGS")
</PRE>
where <TT>LIB_USE</TT> is the place where the Modula-3 libraries have
been installed.
<P>
