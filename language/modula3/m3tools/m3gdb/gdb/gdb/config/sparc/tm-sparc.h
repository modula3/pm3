/* FRAME_CHAIN takes a frame's nominal address

/* In the case of the Sun 4, the frame-chain's nominal address
   is held in the frame pointer register.

   On the Sun4, the frame (in %fp) is %sp for the previous frame.
   From the previous frame's %sp, we can find the previous frame's
   %fp: it is in the save area just above the previous frame's %sp.

   If we are setting up an arbitrary frame, we'll need to know where
   it ends.  Hence the following.  This part of the frame cache
   structure should be checked before it is assumed that this frame's
   bottom is in the stack pointer.

   If there isn't a frame below this one, the bottom of this frame is
   in the stack pointer.

   If there is a frame below this one, and the frame pointers are
   identical, it's a leaf frame and the bottoms are the same also.

   Otherwise the bottom of this frame is the top of the next frame.

   The bottom field is misnamed, since it might imply that memory from
   bottom to frame contains this frame.  That need not be true if
   stack frames are allocated in different segments (e.g. some on a
   stack, some on a heap in the data segment).

   GCC 2.6 and later can generate ``flat register window'' code that
   makes frames by explicitly saving those registers that need to be
   saved.  %i7 is used as the frame pointer, and the frame is laid out
   so that flat and non-flat calls can be intermixed freely within a
   program.  Unfortunately for GDB, this means it must detect and
   record the flatness of frames.

   Since the prologue in a flat frame also tells us where fp and pc
   have been stashed (the frame is of variable size, so their location
   is not fixed), it's convenient to record them in the frame info.  */

 * are designed to do the same thing).
 *
 *   PUSH_DUMMY_FRAME saves the registers above sp' and pushes the
 * register file stack down one.
 *
 *   call_function then writes CALL_DUMMY, pushes the args onto the
 * stack, and adjusts the stack pointer.
 *
 *   run_stack_dummy then starts execution (in the middle of
 * CALL_DUMMY, as directed by call_function).
