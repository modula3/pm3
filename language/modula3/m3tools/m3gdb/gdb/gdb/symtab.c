  /* RT: Further explanation:

   * We have stubs (trampolines) inserted between procedures.
   *
   * Example: "shr1" exists in a shared library, and a "shr1" stub also
   * exists in the main image.
   *
   * In the minimal symbol table, we have a bunch of symbols
   * sorted by start address. The stubs are marked as "trampoline",
   * the others appear as text. E.g.:
   *
   *  Minimal symbol table for main image 
   *     main:  code for main (text symbol)
   *     shr1: stub  (trampoline symbol)
   *     foo:   code for foo (text symbol)
   *     ...
   *  Minimal symbol table for "shr1" image:
   *     ...
   *     shr1: code for shr1 (text symbol)
   *     ...
   *
   * So the code below is trying to detect if we are in the stub
   * ("shr1" stub), and if so, find the real code ("shr1" trampoline),
   * and if found,  do the symbolization from the real-code address
   * rather than the stub address.
   *
   * Assumptions being made about the minimal symbol table:
   *   1. lookup_minimal_symbol_by_pc() will return a trampoline only
   *      if we're really in the trampoline. If we're beyond it (say
   *      we're in "foo" in the above example), it'll have a closer 
   *      symbol (the "foo" text symbol for example) and will not
   *      return the trampoline.
   *   2. lookup_minimal_symbol_text() will find a real text symbol
   *      corresponding to the trampoline, and whose address will
   *      be different than the trampoline address. I put in a sanity
   *      check for the address being the same, to avoid an
   *      infinite recursion.
