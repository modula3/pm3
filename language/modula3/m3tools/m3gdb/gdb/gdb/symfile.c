   compare_psymbols -- compare two partial symbols by name

   DESCRIPTION

   Given pointers to pointers to two partial symbol table entries,
   compare them by name and return -N, 0, or +N (ala strcmp).
   Typically used by sorting routines like qsort().

   NOTES

   Does direct compare of first two characters before punting
   and passing to strcmp for longer compares.  Note that the
   original version had a bug whereby two null strings or two
   identically named one character strings would return the
   comparison of memory following the null byte.

   This function is run after symbol reading, or from a cleanup.
   If an old symbol table was obsoleted, the old symbol table
   has been blown away, but the other GDB data structures that may 
   reference it have not yet been cleared or re-directed.  (The old
   symtab was zapped, and the cleanup queued, in free_named_symtab()
   below.)

   This function can be queued N times as a cleanup, or called
   directly; it will do all the work the first time, and then will be a
   no-op until the next time it is queued.  This works by bumping a
   counter at queueing time.  Much later when the cleanup is run, or at
   the end of symbol processing (in case the cleanup is discarded), if
   the queued count is greater than the "done-count", we do the work
   and set the done-count to the queued count.  If the queued count is
   less than or equal to the done-count, we just ignore the call.  This
   is needed because reading a single .o file will often replace many
   symtabs (one per .h file, for example), and we don't want to reset
   the breakpoints N times in the user's face.

   The reason we both queue a cleanup, and call it directly after symbol
   reading, is because the cleanup protects us in case of errors, but is
   discarded if symbol reading is successful.  */

/* OVERLAYS:
   The following code implements an abstraction for debugging overlay sections.

   The target model is as follows:
   1) The gnu linker will permit multiple sections to be mapped into the
   same VMA, each with its own unique LMA (or load address).
   2) It is assumed that some runtime mechanism exists for mapping the
   sections, one by one, from the load address into the VMA address.
   3) This code provides a mechanism for gdb to keep track of which 
   sections should be considered to be mapped from the VMA to the LMA.
   This information is used for symbol lookup, and memory read/write.
   For instance, if a section has been mapped then its contents 
   should be read from the VMA, otherwise from the LMA.

   Two levels of debugger support for overlays are available.  One is
   "manual", in which the debugger relies on the user to tell it which
   overlays are currently mapped.  This level of support is
   implemented entirely in the core debugger, and the information about
   whether a section is mapped is kept in the objfile->obj_section table.

   The second level of support is "automatic", and is only available if
   the target-specific code provides functionality to read the target's
   overlay mapping table, and translate its contents for the debugger
   (by updating the mapped state information in the obj_section tables).

   The interface is as follows:
   User commands:
   overlay map <name>   -- tell gdb to consider this section mapped
   overlay unmap <name> -- tell gdb to consider this section unmapped
   overlay list         -- list the sections that GDB thinks are mapped
   overlay read-target  -- get the target's state of what's mapped
   overlay off/manual/auto -- set overlay debugging state
   Functional interface:
   find_pc_mapped_section(pc):    if the pc is in the range of a mapped
   section, return that section.
   find_pc_overlay(pc):       find any overlay section that contains 
   the pc, either in its VMA or its LMA
   overlay_is_mapped(sect):       true if overlay is marked as mapped
   section_is_overlay(sect):      true if section's VMA != LMA
   pc_in_mapped_range(pc,sec):    true if pc belongs to section's VMA
   pc_in_unmapped_range(...):     true if pc belongs to section's LMA
   overlay_mapped_address(...):   map an address from section's LMA to VMA
   overlay_unmapped_address(...): map an address from section's VMA to LMA
   symbol_overlayed_address(...): Return a "current" address for symbol:
   either in VMA or LMA depending on whether
   the symbol's section is currently mapped

/* Target Overlays for the "Simplest" overlay manager:

   This is GDB's default target overlay layer.  It works with the 
   minimal overlay manager supplied as an example by Cygnus.  The 
   entry point is via a function pointer "target_overlay_update", 
   so targets that use a different runtime overlay manager can 
   substitute their own overlay_update function and take over the
   function pointer.

   The overlay_update function pokes around in the target's data structures
   to see what overlays are mapped, and updates GDB's overlay mapping with
   this information.

   In this simple implementation, the target data structures are as follows:
   unsigned _novlys;            /# number of overlay sections #/
   unsigned _ovly_table[_novlys][4] = {
   {VMA, SIZE, LMA, MAPPED},    /# one entry per overlay section #/
   {..., ...,  ..., ...},
   }
   unsigned _novly_regions;     /# number of overlay regions #/
   unsigned _ovly_region_table[_novly_regions][3] = {
   {VMA, SIZE, MAPPED_TO_LMA},  /# one entry per overlay region #/
   {..., ...,  ...},
   }
   These functions will attempt to update GDB's mappedness state in the
   symbol section table, based on the target's mappedness state.

   To do this, we keep a cached copy of the target's _ovly_table, and
   attempt to detect when the cached copy is invalidated.  The main
   entry point is "simple_overlay_update(SECT), which looks up SECT in
   the cached table and re-reads only the entry for that section from
   the target (whenever possible).
