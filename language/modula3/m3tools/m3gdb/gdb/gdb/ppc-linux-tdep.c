/* Determine if pc is in a signal trampoline...

   Ha!  That's not what this does at all.  wait_for_inferior in infrun.c
   calls IN_SIGTRAMP in order to detect entry into a signal trampoline
   just after delivery of a signal.  But on linux, signal trampolines
   are used for the return path only.  The kernel sets things up so that
   the signal handler is called directly.

   If we use in_sigtramp2() in place of in_sigtramp() (see below)
   we'll (often) end up with stop_pc in the trampoline and prev_pc in
   the (now exited) handler.  The code there will cause a temporary
   breakpoint to be set on prev_pc which is not very likely to get hit
   again.

   If this is confusing, think of it this way...  the code in
   wait_for_inferior() needs to be able to detect entry into a signal
   trampoline just after a signal is delivered, not after the handler
   has been run.

   So, we define in_sigtramp() below to return 1 if the following is
   true:

   1) The previous frame is a real signal trampoline.

   - and -

   2) pc is at the first or second instruction of the corresponding
   handler.

   Why the second instruction?  It seems that wait_for_inferior()
   never sees the first instruction when single stepping.  When a
   signal is delivered while stepping, the next instruction that
   would've been stepped over isn't, instead a signal is delivered and
   the first instruction of the handler is stepped over instead.  That
   puts us on the second instruction.  (I added the test for the
   first instruction long after the fact, just in case the observed
   behavior is ever fixed.)

   IN_SIGTRAMP is called from blockframe.c as well in order to set
   the signal_handler_caller flag.  Because of our strange definition
   of in_sigtramp below, we can't rely on signal_handler_caller getting
   set correctly from within blockframe.c.  This is why we take pains
   to set it in init_extra_frame_info().  */

   Here is the problem that we're trying to solve...

   Once upon a time, before introducing this function to remove
   breakpoints from the inferior, setting a breakpoint on a shared
   library function prior to running the program would not work
   properly.  In order to understand the problem, it is first
   necessary to understand a little bit about dynamic linking on
   this platform.

   A call to a shared library function is accomplished via a bl
   (branch-and-link) instruction whose branch target is an entry
   in the procedure linkage table (PLT).  The PLT in the object
   file is uninitialized.  To gdb, prior to running the program, the
   entries in the PLT are all zeros.

   Once the program starts running, the shared libraries are loaded
   and the procedure linkage table is initialized, but the entries in
   the table are not (necessarily) resolved.  Once a function is
   actually called, the code in the PLT is hit and the function is
   resolved.  In order to better illustrate this, an example is in
   order; the following example is from the gdb testsuite.
	    
	We start the program shmain.

	    [kev@arroyo testsuite]$ ../gdb gdb.base/shmain
	    [...]

	We place two breakpoints, one on shr1 and the other on main.

	    (gdb) b shr1
	    Breakpoint 1 at 0x100409d4
	    (gdb) b main
	    Breakpoint 2 at 0x100006a0: file gdb.base/shmain.c, line 44.

	Examine the instruction (and the immediatly following instruction)
	upon which the breakpoint was placed.  Note that the PLT entry
	for shr1 contains zeros.

	    (gdb) x/2i 0x100409d4
	    0x100409d4 <shr1>:      .long 0x0
	    0x100409d8 <shr1+4>:    .long 0x0

	Now run 'til main.

	    (gdb) r
	    Starting program: gdb.base/shmain 
	    Breakpoint 1 at 0xffaf790: file gdb.base/shr1.c, line 19.

	    Breakpoint 2, main ()
		at gdb.base/shmain.c:44
	    44        g = 1;

	Examine the PLT again.  Note that the loading of the shared
	library has initialized the PLT to code which loads a constant
	(which I think is an index into the GOT) into r11 and then
	branchs a short distance to the code which actually does the
	resolving.

	    (gdb) x/2i 0x100409d4
	    0x100409d4 <shr1>:      li      r11,4
	    0x100409d8 <shr1+4>:    b       0x10040984 <sg+4>
	    (gdb) c
	    Continuing.

	    Breakpoint 1, shr1 (x=1)
		at gdb.base/shr1.c:19
	    19        l = 1;

	Now we've hit the breakpoint at shr1.  (The breakpoint was
	reset from the PLT entry to the actual shr1 function after the
	shared library was loaded.) Note that the PLT entry has been
	resolved to contain a branch that takes us directly to shr1. 
	(The real one, not the PLT entry.)

	    (gdb) x/2i 0x100409d4
	    0x100409d4 <shr1>:      b       0xffaf76c <shr1>
	    0x100409d8 <shr1+4>:    b       0x10040984 <sg+4>

   The thing to note here is that the PLT entry for shr1 has been
   changed twice.

   Now the problem should be obvious.  GDB places a breakpoint (a
   trap instruction) on the zero value of the PLT entry for shr1. 
   Later on, after the shared library had been loaded and the PLT
   initialized, GDB gets a signal indicating this fact and attempts
   (as it always does when it stops) to remove all the breakpoints.

   The breakpoint removal was causing the former contents (a zero
   word) to be written back to the now initialized PLT entry thus
   destroying a portion of the initialization that had occurred only a
   short time ago.  When execution continued, the zero word would be
   executed as an instruction an an illegal instruction trap was
   generated instead.  (0 is not a legal instruction.)

   The fix for this problem was fairly straightforward.  The function
   memory_remove_breakpoint from mem-break.c was copied to this file,
   modified slightly, and renamed to ppc_linux_memory_remove_breakpoint.
   In tm-linux.h, MEMORY_REMOVE_BREAKPOINT is defined to call this new
   function.

   The differences between ppc_linux_memory_remove_breakpoint () and
   memory_remove_breakpoint () are minor.  All that the former does
   that the latter does not is check to make sure that the breakpoint
   location actually contains a breakpoint (trap instruction) prior
   to attempting to write back the old contents.  If it does contain
   a trap instruction, we allow the old contents to be written back. 
   Otherwise, we silently do nothing.

   The big question is whether memory_remove_breakpoint () should be
   changed to have the same functionality.  The downside is that more
   traffic is generated for remote targets since we'll have an extra
   fetch of a memory word each time a breakpoint is removed.

   For the time being, we'll leave this self-modifying-code-friendly
   version in ppc-linux-tdep.c, but it ought to be migrated somewhere
   else in the event that some other platform has similar needs with
   regard to removing breakpoints in some potentially self modifying
   code.  */
