bfd_target
----------

   *Description*
This structure contains everything that BFD knows about a target. It
includes things like its byte order, name, and which routines to call
to do various operations.

   Every BFD points to a target structure with its `xvec' member.

   The macros below are used to dispatch to functions through the
`bfd_target' vector. They are used in a number of macros further down
in `bfd.h', and are also used when calling various routines by hand
inside the BFD implementation.  The ARGLIST argument must be
parenthesized; it contains all the arguments to the called function.

   They make the documentation (more) unpleasant to read, so if someone
wants to fix this and not break the above, please do.
     #define BFD_SEND(bfd, message, arglist) \
                    ((*((bfd)->xvec->message)) arglist)
     
     #ifdef DEBUG_BFD_SEND
     #undef BFD_SEND
     #define BFD_SEND(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd) && (bfd)->xvec && (bfd)->xvec->message) ? \
         ((*((bfd)->xvec->message)) arglist) : \
         (bfd_assert (__FILE__,__LINE__), NULL))
     #endif
   For operations which index on the BFD format:
     #define BFD_SEND_FMT(bfd, message, arglist) \
                 (((bfd)->xvec->message[(int)((bfd)->format)]) arglist)
     
     #ifdef DEBUG_BFD_SEND
     #undef BFD_SEND_FMT
     #define BFD_SEND_FMT(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd) && (bfd)->xvec && (bfd)->xvec->message) ? \
        (((bfd)->xvec->message[(int)((bfd)->format)]) arglist) : \
        (bfd_assert (__FILE__,__LINE__), NULL))
     #endif
   This is the structure which defines the type of BFD this is.  The
`xvec' member of the struct `bfd' itself points here.  Each module that
implements access to a different target under BFD, defines one of these.

   FIXME, these names should be rationalised with the names of the
entry points which call them. Too bad we can't have one macro to define
them both!

choose the first entry in the target list.  Passing in the string
"default" or setting the environment variable to "default" will cause
the first entry in the target list to be returned, and
"target_defaulted" will be set in the BFD.  This causes
`bfd_check_format' to loop over all the targets to find the one that
matches the file being read.

`bfd_target_list'

   *Synopsis*
     const char **bfd_target_list(void);
   *Description*
Return a freshly malloced NULL-terminated vector of the names of all
the valid BFD targets. Do not modify the names.

Architectures
=============

   BFD keeps one atom in a BFD describing the architecture of the data
attached to the BFD: a pointer to a `bfd_arch_info_type'.

   Pointers to structures can be requested independently of a BFD so
that an architecture's information can be interrogated without access
to an open BFD.

   The architecture information is provided by each architecture
package.  The set of default architectures is selected by the macro
`SELECT_ARCHITECTURES'.  This is normally set up in the
`config/TARGET.mt' file of your choice.  If the name is not defined,
then all the architectures supported are included.

   When BFD starts up, all the architectures are called with an
initialize method.  It is up to the architecture back end to insert as
many items into the list of architectures as it wants to; generally
this would be one for each machine and one for the default case (an
item with a machine field of 0).

   BFD's idea of an architecture is implemented in `archures.c'.

bfd_architecture
----------------

   *Description*
This enum gives the object file's CPU architecture, in a global
sense--i.e., what processor family does it belong to?  Another field
indicates which processor within the family is in use.  The machine
gives a number which distinguishes different versions of the
architecture, containing, for example, 2 and 3 for Intel i960 KA and
i960 KB, and 68020 and 68030 for Motorola 68020 and 68030.

Opening and closing BFDs
========================

`bfd_openr'
...........

   *Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr(CONST char *filename, CONST char *target);
   *Description*
Open the file FILENAME (using `fopen') with the target TARGET.  Return
a pointer to the created BFD.

   Calls `bfd_find_target', so TARGET is interpreted as by that
function.

   If `NULL' is returned then an error has occured.   Possible errors
are `bfd_error_no_memory', `bfd_error_invalid_target' or `system_call'
error.

`bfd_fdopenr'
.............

   *Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_fdopenr(CONST char *filename, CONST char *target, int fd);
   *Description*
`bfd_fdopenr' is to `bfd_fopenr' much like `fdopen' is to `fopen'.  It
opens a BFD on a file already described by the FD supplied.

   When the file is later `bfd_close'd, the file descriptor will be
closed.

   If the caller desires that this file descriptor be cached by BFD
(opened as needed, closed as needed to free descriptors for other
opens), with the supplied FD used as an initial file descriptor (but
subject to closure at any time), call bfd_set_cacheable(bfd, 1) on the
returned BFD.  The default is to assume no cacheing; the file
descriptor will remain open until `bfd_close', and will not be affected
by BFD operations on other files.

   Possible errors are `bfd_error_no_memory',
`bfd_error_invalid_target' and `bfd_error_system_call'.

`bfd_openstreamr'
.................

   *Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openstreamr(const char *, const char *, PTR);
   *Description*
Open a BFD for read access on an existing stdio stream.  When the BFD
is passed to `bfd_close', the stream will be closed.

`bfd_openw'
...........

   *Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openw(CONST char *filename, CONST char *target);
   *Description*
Create a BFD, associated with file FILENAME, using the file format
TARGET, and return a pointer to it.

   Possible errors are `bfd_error_system_call', `bfd_error_no_memory',
`bfd_error_invalid_target'.

`bfd_close'
...........

   *Synopsis*
     boolean bfd_close(bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Close a BFD. If the BFD was open for writing, then pending operations
are completed and the file written out and closed. If the created file
is executable, then `chmod' is called to mark it as such.

   All memory attached to the BFD is released.

   The file descriptor associated with the BFD is closed (even if it
was passed in to BFD by `bfd_fdopenr').

   *Returns*
`true' is returned if all is ok, otherwise `false'.

`bfd_close_all_done'
....................

   *Synopsis*
     boolean bfd_close_all_done(bfd *);
   *Description*
Close a BFD.  Differs from `bfd_close' since it does not complete any
pending operations.  This routine would be used if the application had
just used BFD for swapping and didn't want to use any of the writing
code.

   If the created file is executable, then `chmod' is called to mark it
as such.

   All memory attached to the BFD is released.

   *Returns*
`true' is returned if all is ok, otherwise `false'.

`bfd_create'
............

   *Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_create(CONST char *filename, bfd *templ);
   *Description*
Create a new BFD in the manner of `bfd_openw', but without opening a
file. The new BFD takes the target from the target used by TEMPLATE. The
format is always set to `bfd_object'.

`bfd_alloc'
...........

   *Synopsis*
     PTR bfd_alloc (bfd *abfd, size_t wanted);
   *Description*
Allocate a block of WANTED bytes of memory attached to `abfd' and
return a pointer to it.

Internal functions
==================

   *Description*
These routines are used within BFD.  They are not intended for export,
but are documented here for completeness.

`bfd_write_bigendian_4byte_int'
...............................

   *Synopsis*
     void bfd_write_bigendian_4byte_int(bfd *abfd,  int i);
   *Description*
Write a 4 byte integer I to the output BFD ABFD, in big endian order
regardless of what else is going on.  This is useful in archives.

`bfd_put_size'
..............

`bfd_get_size'
..............

   *Description*
These macros as used for reading and writing raw data in sections; each
access (except for bytes) is vectored through the target format of the
BFD and mangled accordingly. The mangling performs any necessary endian
translations and removes alignment restrictions.  Note that types
accepted and returned by these macros are identical so they can be
swapped around in macros--for example, `libaout.h' defines `GET_WORD'
to either `bfd_get_32' or `bfd_get_64'.

   In the put routines, VAL must be a `bfd_vma'.  If we are on a system
without prototypes, the caller is responsible for making sure that is
true, with a cast if necessary.  We don't cast them in the macro
definitions because that would prevent `lint' or `gcc -Wall' from
detecting sins such as passing a pointer.  To detect calling these with
less than a `bfd_vma', use `gcc -Wconversion' on a host with 64 bit
`bfd_vma''s.

These macros have the same function as their `bfd_get_x' bretheren,
except that they are used for removing information for the header
records of object files. Believe it or not, some object files keep
their header records in big endian order and their data in little
endian order.

File caching
============

   The file caching mechanism is embedded within BFD and allows the
application to open as many BFDs as it wants without regard to the
underlying operating system's file descriptor limit (often as low as 20
open files).  The module in `cache.c' maintains a least recently used
list of `BFD_CACHE_MAX_OPEN' files, and exports the name
`bfd_cache_lookup', which runs around and makes sure that the required
BFD is open. If not, then it chooses a file to close, closes it and
opens the one wanted, returning its file handle.

`BFD_CACHE_MAX_OPEN macro'
..........................

   *Description*
The maximum number of files which the cache will keep open at one time.
     #define BFD_CACHE_MAX_OPEN 10

`bfd_last_cache'
................

   *Synopsis*
     extern bfd *bfd_last_cache;
   *Description*
Zero, or a pointer to the topmost BFD on the chain.  This is used by
the `bfd_cache_lookup' macro in `libbfd.h' to determine when it can
avoid a function call.

`bfd_cache_lookup'
..................

   *Description*
Check to see if the required BFD is the same as the last one looked up.
If so, then it can use the stream in the BFD with impunity, since it
can't have changed since the last lookup; otherwise, it has to perform
the complicated lookup function.
     #define bfd_cache_lookup(x) \
         ((x)==bfd_last_cache? \
           (FILE*)(bfd_last_cache->iostream): \
            bfd_cache_lookup_worker(x))

`bfd_cache_init'
................

   *Synopsis*
     boolean bfd_cache_init (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Add a newly opened BFD to the cache.

`bfd_cache_close'
.................

   *Synopsis*
     boolean bfd_cache_close (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Remove the BFD ABFD from the cache. If the attached file is open, then
close it too.

   *Returns*
`false' is returned if closing the file fails, `true' is returned if
all is well.

`bfd_open_file'
...............

   *Synopsis*
     FILE* bfd_open_file(bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Call the OS to open a file for ABFD.  Return the `FILE *' (possibly
`NULL') that results from this operation.  Set up the BFD so that
future accesses know the file is open. If the `FILE *' returned is
`NULL', then it won't have been put in the cache, so it won't have to
be removed from it.

`bfd_cache_lookup_worker'
.........................

   *Synopsis*
     FILE *bfd_cache_lookup_worker(bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Called when the macro `bfd_cache_lookup' fails to find a quick answer.
Find a file descriptor for ABFD.  If necessary, it open it.  If there
are already more than `BFD_CACHE_MAX_OPEN' files open, it tries to
close one first, to avoid running out of file descriptors.

Linker Functions
================

   The linker uses three special entry points in the BFD target vector.
It is not necessary to write special routines for these entry points
when creating a new BFD back end, since generic versions are provided.
However, writing them can speed up linking and make it use
significantly less runtime memory.

   The first routine creates a hash table used by the other routines.
The second routine adds the symbols from an object file to the hash
table.  The third routine takes all the object files and links them
together to create the output file.  These routines are designed so
that the linker proper does not need to know anything about the symbols
in the object files that it is linking.  The linker merely arranges the
sections as directed by the linker script and lets BFD handle the
details of symbols and relocs.

   The second routine and third routines are passed a pointer to a
`struct bfd_link_info' structure (defined in `bfdlink.h') which holds
information relevant to the link, including the linker hash table
(which was created by the first routine) and a set of callback
functions to the linker proper.

   The generic linker routines are in `linker.c', and use the header
file `genlink.h'.  As of this writing, the only back ends which have
implemented versions of these routines are a.out (in `aoutx.h') and
ECOFF (in `ecoff.c').  The a.out routines are used as examples
throughout this section.

Creating a linker hash table
----------------------------

   The linker routines must create a hash table, which must be derived
from `struct bfd_link_hash_table' described in `bfdlink.c'.  *Note Hash
Tables:: for information on how to create a derived hash table.  This
entry point is called using the target vector of the linker output file.

   The `_bfd_link_hash_table_create' entry point must allocate and
initialize an instance of the desired hash table.  If the back end does
not require any additional information to be stored with the entries in
the hash table, the entry point may simply create a `struct
bfd_link_hash_table'.  Most likely, however, some additional
information will be needed.

   For example, with each entry in the hash table the a.out linker
keeps the index the symbol has in the final output file (this index
number is used so that when doing a relocateable link the symbol index
used in the output file can be quickly filled in when copying over a
reloc).  The a.out linker code defines the required structures and
functions for a hash table derived from `struct bfd_link_hash_table'.
The a.out linker hash table is created by the function
`NAME(aout,link_hash_table_create)'; it simply allocates space for the
hash table, initializes it, and returns a pointer to it.

   When writing the linker routines for a new back end, you will
generally not know exactly which fields will be required until you have
finished.  You should simply create a new hash table which defines no
additional fields, and then simply add fields as they become necessary.

Adding symbols to the hash table
--------------------------------

   The linker proper will call the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' entry point
for each object file or archive which is to be linked (typically these
are the files named on the command line, but some may also come from
the linker script).  The entry point is responsible for examining the
file.  For an object file, BFD must add any relevant symbol information
to the hash table.  For an archive, BFD must determine which elements
of the archive should be used and adding them to the link.

   The a.out version of this entry point is
`NAME(aout,link_add_symbols)'.

Differing file formats
......................

   Normally all the files involved in a link will be of the same
format, but it is also possible to link together different format
object files, and the back end must support that.  The
`_bfd_link_add_symbols' entry point is called via the target vector of
the file to be added.  This has an important consequence: the function
may not assume that the hash table is the type created by the
corresponding `_bfd_link_hash_table_create' vector.  All the
`_bfd_link_add_symbols' function can assume about the hash table is
that it is derived from `struct bfd_link_hash_table'.

   Sometimes the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' function must store some
information in the hash table entry to be used by the `_bfd_final_link'
function.  In such a case the `creator' field of the hash table must be
checked to make sure that the hash table was created by an object file
of the same format.

   The `_bfd_final_link' routine must be prepared to handle a hash
entry without any extra information added by the
`_bfd_link_add_symbols' function.  A hash entry without extra
information will also occur when the linker script directs the linker
to create a symbol.  Note that, regardless of how a hash table entry is
added, all the fields will be initialized to some sort of null value by
the hash table entry initialization function.

   See `ecoff_link_add_externals' for an example of how to check the
`creator' field before saving information (in this case, the ECOFF
external symbol debugging information) in a hash table entry.

Adding symbols from an object file
..................................

   When the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is passed an object file,
it must add all externally visible symbols in that object file to the
hash table.  The actual work of adding the symbol to the hash table is
normally handled by the function `_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'.
The `_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is responsible for reading all the
symbols from the object file and passing the correct information to
`_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'.

   The `_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine should not use
`bfd_canonicalize_symtab' to read the symbols.  The point of providing
this routine is to avoid the overhead of converting the symbols into
generic `asymbol' structures.

   `_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol' handles the details of combining
common symbols, warning about multiple definitions, and so forth.  It
takes arguments which describe the symbol to add, notably symbol flags,
a section, and an offset.  The symbol flags include such things as
`BSF_WEAK' or `BSF_INDIRECT'.  The section is a section in the object
file, or something like `bfd_und_section_ptr' for an undefined symbol
or `bfd_com_section_ptr' for a common symbol.

   If the `_bfd_final_link' routine is also going to need to read the
symbol information, the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine should save it
somewhere attached to the object file BFD.  However, the information
should only be saved if the `keep_memory' field of the `info' argument
is true, so that the `-no-keep-memory' linker switch is effective.

   The a.out function which adds symbols from an object file is
`aout_link_add_object_symbols', and most of the interesting work is in
`aout_link_add_symbols'.  The latter saves pointers to the hash tables
entries created by `_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol' indexed by symbol
number, so that the `_bfd_final_link' routine does not have to call the
hash table lookup routine to locate the entry.
