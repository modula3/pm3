NAME
     udi - UDI Configuration Files for DOS hosts.



DESCRIPTION
     A UDI conformant Debugger Front End (DFE) specifies the Tar-
     get Interface Process (TIP) that it wishes to connect to and
     the options that it wishes to pass to that TIP by  referenc-
     ing  a  configuration in the "UDI configuration file".  This
     man page explains the format of the UDI  Configuration  file
     for DOS hosts.

     The search rules that the DFE uses to locate the UDI  Confi-
     guration file are:

          the complete  filename  specified  by  the  environment
          variable, UDICONF.

          the file udiconfs.txt in the current directory.

          the file udiconfs.txt in each of the directories speci-
          fied by the PATH environment variable.


     Each line of the udi_soc  file  consists  of  the  following
     fields:

          tip_config_name  tip_executable  [tip_options]

     tip_config_name
               An arbitrary name which the DFE will use to  refer
               to  this  configuration.  Each line in the udi_soc
               file must have a different tip_config_name field.

     tip_executable
               The name of the TIP executable file.  The DFE will
               use  the  tip_executable filename to spawn the TIP
               if the TIP is not already running. If a full path-
               name  is not specified, the PATH environment vari-
               able is used to locate the executable file.


     tip_options
               The rest of the line after the tip_executable name
               is passed to the TIP at connect time.

      iss050  isstip.exe -29050 -r osboot

     The  above  entry  associates  the  TIP  configuration  name
     "iss050"  with the isstip.exe executable with the parameters
     "-29050 -r osboot" being passed to  isstip.exe  when  it  is
     invoked.   If isstip.exe is not already running and needs to
     be spawned, the PATH environment variable will  be  used  to
     locate the file isstip.exe.
