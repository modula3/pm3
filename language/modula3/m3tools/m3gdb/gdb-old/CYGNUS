About Cygnus Support
*********************

   Cygnus Support was founded in 1989 to provide commercial support for
free software.  Cygnus supplies products and services that benefit
advanced development groups by allowing them to use state-of-the-art
tools without having to maintain them.  With Cygnus Support, sites that
once were forced to do their own tool support can recover that valuable
staff time.  Former users of proprietary software now may choose
supported free software, combining the advantages of both worlds.

   Free software is faster, more powerful, and more portable than its
proprietary counterparts.  It evolves faster because users who want to
make improvements are free to do so.  Cygnus tracks these improvements
and integrates them into tested, stable versions ready for commercial
use, then backs this software with comprehensive support.

   With Cygnus Support as your partner, you will have the software and
the support you need to meet your business objectives.  Cygnus is
intimately familiar with this software from extensive experience using,
debugging, and implementing it.  You get direct access to the most
qualified support people: the authors of the software.

   Because all our improvements are also free software, you can
distribute them widely within your organization, or to your customers,
without extra cost.
