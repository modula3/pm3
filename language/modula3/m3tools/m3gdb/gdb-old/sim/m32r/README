This is the m32r simulator directory.

It is still work-in-progress.  The current sources are reasonably
well tested and lots of features are in.  However, there's lots
more yet to come.

There are some machine generated files in this directory and yet
there is no visible machine generator.  The machine generator
isn't ready to check in.  For the time being, pretend the files
are not machine generated - the onus is on me to avoid lossage.
