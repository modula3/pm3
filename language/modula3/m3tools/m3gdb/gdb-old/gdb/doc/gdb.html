<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC1">Summary of GDB</A></H1>

<P>
The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is
going on "inside" another program while it executes--or what another
program was doing at the moment it crashed.

</P>
<P>
GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

<LI>

Make your program stop on specified conditions.

<LI>

Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

<LI>

Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
</UL>

<P>
You can use GDB to debug programs written in C or C++.
For more information, see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC73">C and C++</A>.

</P>
<P>
Support for Modula-2 and Chill is partial.  For information on Modula-2,
see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC81">Modula-2</A>.  There is no further documentation on Chill yet.

</P>
<P>
Debugging Pascal programs which use sets, subranges, file variables, or nested
functions does not currently work.  GDB does not support
entering expressions, printing values, or similar features using Pascal syntax.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
GDB can be used to debug programs written in Fortran, although
it does not yet support entering expressions, printing values, or
similar features using Fortran syntax.  It may be necessary to refer to
some variables with a trailing underscore.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC2">Free software</A></H2>

<P>
GDB is <STRONG>free software</STRONG>, protected by the GNU 
General Public License
(GPL).  The GPL gives you the freedom to copy or adapt a licensed
program--but every person getting a copy also gets with it the
freedom to modify that copy (which means that they must get access to
the source code), and the freedom to distribute further copies.
Typical software companies use copyrights to limit your freedoms; the
Free Software Foundation uses the GPL to preserve these freedoms.

</P>
<P>
Fundamentally, the General Public License is a license which says that
you have these freedoms and that you cannot take these freedoms away
from anyone else.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC3">Contributors to GDB</A></H2>

<P>
Richard Stallman was the original author of GDB, and of many other GNU
programs.  Many others have contributed to its development.  This
section attempts to credit major contributors.  One of the virtues of
free software is that everyone is free to contribute to it; with
regret, we cannot actually acknowledge everyone here.  The file
<TT>`ChangeLog'</TT> in the GDB distribution approximates a blow-by-blow
account.

</P>
<P>
Changes much prior to version 2.0 are lost in the mists of time.

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Plea:</EM> Additions to this section are particularly welcome.  If you
or your friends (or enemies, to be evenhanded) have been unfairly
omitted from this list, we would like to add your names!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
So that they may not regard their long labor as thankless, we
particularly thank those who shepherded GDB through major releases:
Stan Shebs (release 4.14),
Fred Fish (releases 4.13, 4.12, 4.11, 4.10, and 4.9),
Stu Grossman and John Gilmore (releases 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5, and 4.4),
John Gilmore (releases 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, and 3.9);
Jim Kingdon (releases 3.5, 3.4, and 3.3);
and Randy Smith (releases 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0).
As major maintainer of GDB for some period, each
contributed significantly to the structure, stability, and capabilities
of the entire debugger.

</P>
<P>
Richard Stallman, assisted at various times by Peter TerMaat, Chris
Hanson, and Richard Mlynarik, handled releases through 2.8.

</P>
<P>
Michael Tiemann is the author of most of the GNU C++ support in GDB,
with significant additional contributions from Per Bothner.  James
Clark wrote the GNU C++ demangler.  Early work on C++ was by Peter
TerMaat (who also did much general update work leading to release 3.0).

</P>
<P>
GDB 4 uses the BFD subroutine library to examine multiple
object-file formats; BFD was a joint project of David V.
Henkel-Wallace, Rich Pixley, Steve Chamberlain, and John Gilmore.

</P>
<P>
David Johnson wrote the original COFF support; Pace Willison did
the original support for encapsulated COFF.

</P>
<P>
Brent Benson of Harris Computer Systems contributed DWARF 2 support.

</P>
<P>
Adam de Boor and Bradley Davis contributed the ISI Optimum V support.
Per Bothner, Noboyuki Hikichi, and Alessandro Forin contributed MIPS
support.
Jean-Daniel Fekete contributed Sun 386i support.
Chris Hanson improved the HP9000 support.
Noboyuki Hikichi and Tomoyuki Hasei contributed Sony/News OS 3 support.
David Johnson contributed Encore Umax support.
Jyrki Kuoppala contributed Altos 3068 support.
Jeff Law contributed HP PA and SOM support.
Keith Packard contributed NS32K support.
Doug Rabson contributed Acorn Risc Machine support.
Bob Rusk contributed Harris Nighthawk CX-UX support.
Chris Smith contributed Convex support (and Fortran debugging).
Jonathan Stone contributed Pyramid support.
Michael Tiemann contributed SPARC support.
Tim Tucker contributed support for the Gould NP1 and Gould Powernode.
Pace Willison contributed Intel 386 support.
Jay Vosburgh contributed Symmetry support.

</P>
<P>
Rich Schaefer and Peter Schauer helped with support of SunOS shared
libraries.

</P>
<P>
Jay Fenlason and Roland McGrath ensured that GDB and GAS agree about
several machine instruction sets.

</P>
<P>
Patrick Duval, Ted Goldstein, Vikram Koka and Glenn Engel helped develop
remote debugging.  Intel Corporation, Wind River Systems, AMD, and ARM
contributed remote debugging modules for the i960, VxWorks, A29K UDI,
and RDI targets, respectively.

</P>
<P>
Brian Fox is the author of the readline libraries providing
command-line editing and command history.

</P>
<P>
Andrew Beers of SUNY Buffalo wrote the language-switching code,
the Modula-2 support,
and contributed the Languages chapter of this manual.

</P>
<P>
Fred Fish wrote most of the support for Unix System Vr4.  
He also enhanced the command-completion support to cover C++ overloaded
symbols.

</P>
<P>
Hitachi America, Ltd. sponsored the support for Hitachi microprocessors.

</P>
<P>
Kung Hsu, Jeff Law, and Rick Sladkey added support for hardware
watchpoints.

<P>
Cygnus Solutions has sponsored GDB maintenance and much of its
development since 1991.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC4">A Sample GDB Session</A></H1>

<P>
You can use this manual at your leisure to read all about GDB.
However, a handful of commands are enough to get started using the
debugger.  This chapter illustrates those commands.

</P>
<P>
In this sample session, we emphasize user input like this: <B>input</B>,
to make it easier to pick out from the surrounding output.

</P>

<P>
One of the preliminary versions of GNU <CODE>m4</CODE> (a generic macro
processor) exhibits the following bug: sometimes, when we change its
quote strings from the default, the commands used to capture one macro
definition within another stop working.  In the following short <CODE>m4</CODE>
session, we define a macro <CODE>foo</CODE> which expands to <CODE>0000</CODE>; we
then use the <CODE>m4</CODE> built-in <CODE>defn</CODE> to define <CODE>bar</CODE> as the
same thing.  However, when we change the open quote string to
<CODE>&#60;QUOTE&#62;</CODE> and the close quote string to <CODE>&#60;UNQUOTE&#62;</CODE>, the same
procedure fails to define a new synonym <CODE>baz</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
$ <B>cd gnu/m4</B>
$ <B>./m4</B>
<B>define(foo,0000)</B>

<B>foo</B>
0000
<B>define(bar,defn(`foo'))</B>

<B>bar</B>
0000
<B>changequote(&#60;QUOTE&#62;,&#60;UNQUOTE&#62;)</B>

<B>define(baz,defn(&#60;QUOTE&#62;foo&#60;UNQUOTE&#62;))</B>
<B>baz</B>
<B>C-d</B>
m4: End of input: 0: fatal error: EOF in string
</PRE>

<P>
Let us use GDB to try to see what is going on.

</P>

<PRE>
$ <B>gdb m4</B>
GDB is free software and you are welcome to distribute copies
 of it under certain conditions; type "show copying" to see 
 the conditions.
There is absolutely no warranty for GDB; type "show warranty" 
 for details.

(gdb)
</PRE>

<P>
GDB reads only enough symbol data to know where to find the
rest when needed; as a result, the first prompt comes up very quickly.
We now tell GDB to use a narrower display width than usual, so
that examples fit in this manual.

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>set width 70</B>
</PRE>

<P>
We need to see how the <CODE>m4</CODE> built-in <CODE>changequote</CODE> works.
Having looked at the source, we know the relevant subroutine is
<CODE>m4_changequote</CODE>, so we set a breakpoint there with the GDB
<CODE>break</CODE> command.

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>break m4_changequote</B>
Breakpoint 1 at 0x62f4: file builtin.c, line 879.
</PRE>

<P>
Using the <CODE>run</CODE> command, we start <CODE>m4</CODE> running under GDB
control; as long as control does not reach the <CODE>m4_changequote</CODE>
subroutine, the program runs as usual:

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>run</B>
Starting program: /work/Editorial/gdb/gnu/m4/m4
<B>define(foo,0000)</B>

<B>foo</B>
0000
</PRE>

<P>
To trigger the breakpoint, we call <CODE>changequote</CODE>.  GDB
suspends execution of <CODE>m4</CODE>, displaying information about the
context where it stops.

</P>

<PRE>
<B>changequote(&#60;QUOTE&#62;,&#60;UNQUOTE&#62;)</B>

Breakpoint 1, m4_changequote (argc=3, argv=0x33c70) 
    at builtin.c:879
879         if (bad_argc(TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[0]),argc,1,3))
</PRE>

<P>
Now we use the command <CODE>n</CODE> (<CODE>next</CODE>) to advance execution to
the next line of the current function.

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>n</B>
882         set_quotes((argc &#62;= 2) ? TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[1])\
 : nil,
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>set_quotes</CODE> looks like a promising subroutine.  We can go into it
by using the command <CODE>s</CODE> (<CODE>step</CODE>) instead of <CODE>next</CODE>.
<CODE>step</CODE> goes to the next line to be executed in <EM>any</EM>
subroutine, so it steps into <CODE>set_quotes</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>s</B>
set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "&#60;QUOTE&#62;", rq=0x34c88 "&#60;UNQUOTE&#62;")
    at input.c:530
530         if (lquote != def_lquote)
</PRE>

<P>
The display that shows the subroutine where <CODE>m4</CODE> is now
suspended (and its arguments) is called a stack frame display.  It
shows a summary of the stack.  We can use the <CODE>backtrace</CODE>
command (which can also be spelled <CODE>bt</CODE>), to see where we are
in the stack as a whole: the <CODE>backtrace</CODE> command displays a
stack frame for each active subroutine.

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>bt</B>
#0  set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "&#60;QUOTE&#62;", rq=0x34c88 "&#60;UNQUOTE&#62;")
    at input.c:530
#1  0x6344 in m4_changequote (argc=3, argv=0x33c70) 
    at builtin.c:882
#2  0x8174 in expand_macro (sym=0x33320) at macro.c:242
#3  0x7a88 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=209696, td=0xf7fffa30)
    at macro.c:71
#4  0x79dc in expand_input () at macro.c:40
#5  0x2930 in main (argc=0, argv=0xf7fffb20) at m4.c:195
</PRE>

<P>
We step through a few more lines to see what happens.  The first two
times, we can use <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>; the next two times we use <CODE>n</CODE> to avoid
falling into the <CODE>xstrdup</CODE> subroutine.

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>s</B>
0x3b5c  532         if (rquote != def_rquote)
(gdb) <B>s</B>
0x3b80  535         lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == '\0') ?  \
def_lquote : xstrdup(lq);
(gdb) <B>n</B>
536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == '\0') ? def_rquote\
 : xstrdup(rq);
(gdb) <B>n</B>
538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);
</PRE>

<P>
The last line displayed looks a little odd; we can examine the variables
<CODE>lquote</CODE> and <CODE>rquote</CODE> to see if they are in fact the new left
and right quotes we specified.  We use the command <CODE>p</CODE>
(<CODE>print</CODE>) to see their values.

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>p lquote</B>
$1 = 0x35d40 "&#60;QUOTE&#62;"
(gdb) <B>p rquote</B>
$2 = 0x35d50 "&#60;UNQUOTE&#62;"
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>lquote</CODE> and <CODE>rquote</CODE> are indeed the new left and right quotes.
To look at some context, we can display ten lines of source
surrounding the current line with the <CODE>l</CODE> (<CODE>list</CODE>) command.

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>l</B>
533             xfree(rquote);
534
535         lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == '\0') ? def_lquote\
 : xstrdup (lq);
536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == '\0') ? def_rquote\
 : xstrdup (rq);
537
538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);
539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
540     }
541
542     void
</PRE>

<P>
Let us step past the two lines that set <CODE>len_lquote</CODE> and
<CODE>len_rquote</CODE>, and then examine the values of those variables.

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>n</B>
539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
(gdb) <B>n</B>
540     }
(gdb) <B>p len_lquote</B>
$3 = 9
(gdb) <B>p len_rquote</B>
$4 = 7
</PRE>

<P>
That certainly looks wrong, assuming <CODE>len_lquote</CODE> and
<CODE>len_rquote</CODE> are meant to be the lengths of <CODE>lquote</CODE> and
<CODE>rquote</CODE> respectively.  We can set them to better values using
the <CODE>p</CODE> command, since it can print the value of
any expression--and that expression can include subroutine calls and
assignments.

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>p len_lquote=strlen(lquote)</B>
$5 = 7
(gdb) <B>p len_rquote=strlen(rquote)</B>
$6 = 9
</PRE>

<P>
Is that enough to fix the problem of using the new quotes with the
<CODE>m4</CODE> built-in <CODE>defn</CODE>?  We can allow <CODE>m4</CODE> to continue
executing with the <CODE>c</CODE> (<CODE>continue</CODE>) command, and then try the
example that caused trouble initially:

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>c</B>
Continuing.

<B>define(baz,defn(&#60;QUOTE&#62;foo&#60;UNQUOTE&#62;))</B>

baz
0000
</PRE>

<P>
Success!  The new quotes now work just as well as the default ones.  The
problem seems to have been just the two typos defining the wrong
lengths.  We allow <CODE>m4</CODE> exit by giving it an EOF as input:

</P>

<PRE>
<B>C-d</B>
Program exited normally.
</PRE>

<P>
The message <SAMP>`Program exited normally.'</SAMP> is from GDB; it
indicates <CODE>m4</CODE> has finished executing.  We can end our GDB
session with the GDB <CODE>quit</CODE> command.

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) <B>quit</B>
</PRE>



<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC5">Getting In and Out of GDB</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter discusses how to start GDB, and how to get out of it.
The essentials are: 

<UL>
<LI>

type <SAMP>`gdb'</SAMP> to start GDB.
<LI>

type <KBD>quit</KBD> or <KBD>C-d</KBD> to exit.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC6">Invoking GDB</A></H2>

<P>
Invoke GDB by running the program <CODE>gdb</CODE>.  Once started,
GDB reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit.

</P>
<P>
You can also run <CODE>gdb</CODE> with a variety of arguments and options,
to specify more of your debugging environment at the outset.

</P>
<P>
The command-line options described here are designed
to cover a variety of situations; in some environments, some of these
options may effectively be unavailable.  

</P>
<P>
The most usual way to start GDB is with one argument,
specifying an executable program:

</P>

<PRE>
gdb <VAR>program</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
You can also start with both an executable program and a core file
specified:

</P>

<PRE>
gdb <VAR>program</VAR> <VAR>core</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you want
to debug a running process:

</P>

<PRE>
gdb <VAR>program</VAR> 1234
</PRE>

<P>
would attach GDB to process <CODE>1234</CODE> (unless you also have a file
named <TT>`1234'</TT>; GDB does check for a core file first).

</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the second command-line argument requires a fairly
complete operating system; when you use GDB as a remote debugger
attached to a bare board, there may not be any notion of "process",
and there is often no way to get a core dump.

</P>
<P>
You can run <CODE>gdb</CODE> without printing the front material, which describes
GDB's non-warranty, by specifying <CODE>-silent</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
gdb <VAR>-silent</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
You can further control how GDB starts up by using command-line
options.  GDB itself can remind you of the options available.

</P>
<P>
Type

</P>

<PRE>
gdb -help
</PRE>

<P>
to display all available options and briefly describe their use
(<SAMP>`gdb -h'</SAMP> is a shorter equivalent).

</P>
<P>
All options and command line arguments you give are processed
in sequential order.  The order makes a difference when the
<SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> option is used.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC7">Choosing files</A></H3>

<P>
When GDB starts, it reads any arguments other than options as
specifying an executable file and core file (or process ID).  This is
the same as if the arguments were specified by the <SAMP>`-se'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> options respectively.  (GDB reads the first argument
that does not have an associated option flag as equivalent to the
<SAMP>`-se'</SAMP> option followed by that argument; and the second argument
that does not have an associated option flag, if any, as equivalent to
the <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> option followed by that argument.)

</P>
<P>
Many options have both long and short forms; both are shown in the
following list.  GDB also recognizes the long forms if you truncate
them, so long as enough of the option is present to be unambiguous.
(If you prefer, you can flag option arguments with <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> rather
than <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, though we illustrate the more usual convention.)

<EM>Warning: this option depends on operating system facilities that are not

If memory-mapped files are available on your system through the <CODE>mmap</CODE>
system call, you can use this option 
to have GDB write the symbols from your
program into a reusable file in the current directory.  If the program you are debugging is
called <TT>`/tmp/fred'</TT>, the mapped symbol file is <TT>`./fred.syms'</TT>.
Future GDB debugging sessions notice the presence of this file,
and can quickly map in symbol information from it, rather than reading
the symbol table from the executable program.

The <TT>`.syms'</TT> file is specific to the host machine where GDB
is run.  It holds an exact image of the internal GDB symbol
table.  It cannot be shared across multiple host platforms.

<DT><CODE>-r</CODE>

Read each symbol file's entire symbol table immediately, rather than
the default, which is to read it incrementally as it is needed.
This makes startup slower, but makes future operations faster.

<P>
The <CODE>-mapped</CODE> and <CODE>-readnow</CODE> options are typically combined in
order to build a <TT>`.syms'</TT> file that contains complete symbol
information.  (See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC99">Commands to specify files</A>, for information

<TT>`.gdbinit'</TT>).  Normally, the commands in these files are
executed after all the command options and arguments have been
processed.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC148">Command files</A>.

<DT><CODE>-quiet</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>
"Quiet".  Do not print the introductory and copyright messages.  These
messages are also suppressed in batch mode.

<DT><CODE>-batch</CODE>
<DD>
Run in batch mode.  Exit with status <CODE>0</CODE> after processing all the
command files specified with <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> (and all commands from
initialization files, if not inhibited with <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>).  Exit with
nonzero status if an error occurs in executing the GDB commands
in the command files.

Batch mode may be useful for running GDB as a filter, for example to
download and run a program on another computer; in order to make this
more useful, the message


<PRE>
Program exited normally.
</PRE>

(which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under GDB control
terminates) is not issued when running in batch mode.

<DT><CODE>-cd <VAR>directory</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Run GDB using <VAR>directory</VAR> as its working directory,
instead of the current directory.

<DT><CODE>-fullname</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
GNU Emacs sets this option when it runs GDB as a subprocess.  It tells GDB
to output the full file name and line number in a standard,
recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is displayed (which
includes each time your program stops).  This recognizable format looks
like two <SAMP>`\032'</SAMP> characters, followed by the file name, line number
and character position separated by colons, and a newline.  The
Emacs-to-GDB interface program uses the two <SAMP>`\032'</SAMP> characters as
a signal to display the source code for the frame.

<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>bps</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set the line speed (baud rate or bits per second) of any serial
interface used by GDB for remote debugging.

<DT><CODE>-tty <VAR>device</VAR></CODE>

<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX5"></A>
 
To exit GDB, use the <CODE>quit</CODE> command (abbreviated <CODE>q</CODE>), or 
type an end-of-file character (usually <KBD>C-d</KBD>).  If you do not supply 
<VAR>expression</VAR>, GDB will terminate normally; otherwise it will 
terminate using the result of <VAR>expression</VAR> as the error code.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
An interrupt (often <KBD>C-c</KBD>) does not exit from GDB, but rather
terminates the action of any GDB command that is in progress and
returns to GDB command level.  It is safe to type the interrupt
character at any time because GDB does not allow it to take effect
until a time when it is safe.

</P>
<P>
If you have been using GDB to control an attached process or
device, you can release it with the <CODE>detach</CODE> command

<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC10">Shell commands</A></H2>

<P>
If you need to execute occasional shell commands during your

just use the <CODE>shell</CODE> command.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>shell <VAR>command string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX8"></A>
 
Invoke a the standard shell to execute <VAR>command string</VAR>.
If it exists, the environment variable <CODE>SHELL</CODE> determines which
shell to run.  Otherwise GDB uses <CODE>/bin/sh</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
The utility <CODE>make</CODE> is often needed in development environments.
You do not have to use the <CODE>shell</CODE> command for this purpose in
GDB:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>make <VAR>make-args</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX10"></A>
 
Execute the <CODE>make</CODE> program with the specified

</DL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC11">GDB Commands</A></H1>

<P>
You can abbreviate a GDB command to the first few letters of the command
name, if that abbreviation is unambiguous; and you can repeat certain
GDB commands by typing just <KBD>RET</KBD>.  You can also use the <KBD>TAB</KBD>
key to get GDB to fill out the rest of a word in a command (or to
show you the alternatives available, if there is more than one possibility).

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC12">Command syntax</A></H2>

<P>
A GDB command is a single line of input.  There is no limit on
how long it can be.  It starts with a command name, which is followed by
arguments whose meaning depends on the command name.  For example, the
command <CODE>step</CODE> accepts an argument which is the number of times to
step, as in <SAMP>`step 5'</SAMP>.  You can also use the <CODE>step</CODE> command
with no arguments.  Some command names do not allow any arguments.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
GDB command names may always be truncated if that abbreviation is
unambiguous.  Other possible command abbreviations are listed in the
documentation for individual commands.  In some cases, even ambiguous
abbreviations are allowed; for example, <CODE>s</CODE> is specially defined as
equivalent to <CODE>step</CODE> even though there are other commands whose
names start with <CODE>s</CODE>.  You can test abbreviations by using them as
arguments to the <CODE>help</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
A blank line as input to GDB (typing just <KBD>RET</KBD>) means to
repeat the previous command. Certain commands (for example, <CODE>run</CODE>)
will not repeat this way; these are commands whose unintentional
repetition might cause trouble and which you are unlikely to want to
repeat.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>list</CODE> and <CODE>x</CODE> commands, when you repeat them with
<KBD>RET</KBD>, construct new arguments rather than repeating
exactly as typed.  This permits easy scanning of source or memory.

</P>
<P>
GDB can also use <KBD>RET</KBD> in another way: to partition lengthy
output, in a way similar to the common utility <CODE>more</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC142">Screen size</A>).  Since it is easy to press one
<KBD>RET</KBD> too many in this situation, GDB disables command
repetition after any command that generates this sort of display.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
Any text from a <KBD>#</KBD> to the end of the line is a comment; it does
nothing.  This is useful mainly in command files (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC148">Command files</A>).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC13">Command completion</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
GDB can fill in the rest of a word in a command for you, if there is
only one possibility; it can also show you what the valid possibilities
are for the next word in a command, at any time.  This works for GDB
commands, GDB subcommands, and the names of symbols in your program.

</P>
<P>
Press the <KBD>TAB</KBD> key whenever you want GDB to fill out the rest
of a word.  If there is only one possibility, GDB fills in the
word, and waits for you to finish the command (or press <KBD>RET</KBD> to
enter it).  For example, if you type

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) info bre <KBD>TAB</KBD>
</PRE>

<P>
GDB fills in the rest of the word <SAMP>`breakpoints'</SAMP>, since that is
the only <CODE>info</CODE> subcommand beginning with <SAMP>`bre'</SAMP>:

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) info breakpoints
</PRE>

<P>
You can either press <KBD>RET</KBD> at this point, to run the <CODE>info
breakpoints</CODE> command, or backspace and enter something else, if
<SAMP>`breakpoints'</SAMP> does not look like the command you expected.  (If you
were sure you wanted <CODE>info breakpoints</CODE> in the first place, you
might as well just type <KBD>RET</KBD> immediately after <SAMP>`info bre'</SAMP>,
to exploit command abbreviations rather than command completion).

</P>
<P>
If there is more than one possibility for the next word when you press
<KBD>TAB</KBD>, GDB sounds a bell.  You can either supply more
characters and try again, or just press <KBD>TAB</KBD> a second time;
GDB displays all the possible completions for that word.  For
example, you might want to set a breakpoint on a subroutine whose name
begins with <SAMP>`make_'</SAMP>, but when you type <KBD>b make_<KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD> GDB
just sounds the bell.  Typing <KBD>TAB</KBD> again displays all the
function names in your program that begin with those characters, for
example:

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) b make_ <KBD>TAB</KBD>
GDB sounds bell; press <KBD>TAB</KBD> again, to see:
make_a_section_from_file     make_environ               
make_abs_section             make_function_type         
make_blockvector             make_pointer_type          
make_cleanup                 make_reference_type        
make_command                 make_symbol_completion_list
(gdb) b make_
</PRE>

<P>
After displaying the available possibilities, GDB copies your
partial input (<SAMP>`b make_'</SAMP> in the example) so you can finish the
command.

</P>
<P>
If you just want to see the list of alternatives in the first place, you
can press <KBD>M-?</KBD> rather than pressing <KBD>TAB</KBD> twice. <KBD>M-?</KBD>
means <KBD><KBD>META</KBD> ?</KBD>.  You can type this
either by holding down a
key designated as the <KBD>META</KBD> shift on your keyboard (if there is
one) while typing <KBD>?</KBD>, or
as <KBD>ESC</KBD> followed by <KBD>?</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
Sometimes the string you need, while logically a "word", may contain
parentheses or other characters that GDB normally excludes from its
notion of a word.  To permit word completion to work in this situation,
you may enclose words in <CODE>'</CODE> (single quote marks) in GDB commands.

</P>
<P>
The most likely situation where you might need this is in typing the
name of a C++ function.  This is because C++ allows function overloading
(multiple definitions of the same function, distinguished by argument
type).  For example, when you want to set a breakpoint you may need to
distinguish whether you mean the version of <CODE>name</CODE> that takes an
<CODE>int</CODE> parameter, <CODE>name(int)</CODE>, or the version that takes a
<CODE>float</CODE> parameter, <CODE>name(float)</CODE>.  To use the word-completion
facilities in this situation, type a single quote <CODE>'</CODE> at the
beginning of the function name.  This alerts GDB that it may need to
consider more information than usual when you press <KBD>TAB</KBD> or
<KBD>M-?</KBD> to request word completion:

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) b 'bubble( <KBD>M-?</KBD>
bubble(double,double)    bubble(int,int)
(gdb) b 'bubble(
</PRE>

<P>
In some cases, GDB can tell that completing a name requires using
quotes.  When this happens, GDB inserts the quote for you (while
completing as much as it can) if you do not type the quote in the first
place:

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) b bub <KBD>TAB</KBD>
GDB alters your input line to the following, and rings a bell:
(gdb) b 'bubble(
</PRE>

<P>
In general, GDB can tell that a quote is needed (and inserts it) if
you have not yet started typing the argument list when you ask for
completion on an overloaded symbol.

</P>

You can use <CODE>help</CODE> (abbreviated <CODE>h</CODE>) with no arguments to
display a short list of named classes of commands:


<PRE>
(gdb) help
List of classes of commands:

running -- Running the program
stack -- Examining the stack

breakpoints -- Making program stop at certain points
files -- Specifying and examining files
status -- Status inquiries
support -- Support facilities
user-defined -- User-defined commands

<PRE>
(gdb) help status
Status inquiries.

(gdb)
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>help <VAR>command</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
With a command name as <CODE>help</CODE> argument, GDB displays a
short paragraph on how to use that command.

<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<DT><CODE>complete <VAR>args</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>complete <VAR>args</VAR></CODE> command lists all the possible completions
for the beginning of a command.  Use <VAR>args</VAR> to specify the beginning of the
command you want completed.  For example:


<PRE>
complete i
</PRE>

results in:


<PRE>

inspect
ignore
</PRE>

This is intended for use by GNU Emacs.
</DL>

<P>
In addition to <CODE>help</CODE>, you can use the GDB commands <CODE>info</CODE>
and <CODE>show</CODE> to inquire about the state of your program, or the state
of GDB itself.  Each command supports many topics of inquiry; this
manual introduces each of them in the appropriate context.  The listings
under <CODE>info</CODE> and under <CODE>show</CODE> in the Index point to
all the sub-commands.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC159">Index</A>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>info</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX25"></A>
 
This command (abbreviated <CODE>i</CODE>) is for describing the state of your
program.  For example, you can list the arguments given to your program
with <CODE>info args</CODE>, list the registers currently in use with <CODE>info
registers</CODE>, or list the breakpoints you have set with <CODE>info breakpoints</CODE>.
You can get a complete list of the <CODE>info</CODE> sub-commands with
<CODE>help info</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<DT><CODE>set</CODE>
<DD>
You can assign the result of an expresson to an environment variable with 
<CODE>set</CODE>.  For example, you can set the GDB prompt to a $-sign with
<CODE>set prompt $</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<DT><CODE>show</CODE>
<DD>
In contrast to <CODE>info</CODE>, <CODE>show</CODE> is for describing the state of 
GDB itself.
You can change most of the things you can <CODE>show</CODE>, by using the
related command <CODE>set</CODE>; for example, you can control what number
system is used for displays with <CODE>set radix</CODE>, or simply inquire
which is currently in use with <CODE>show radix</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
To display all the settable parameters and their current
values, you can use <CODE>show</CODE> with no arguments; you may also use
<CODE>info set</CODE>.  Both commands produce the same display.
</DL>

<P>
Here are three miscellaneous <CODE>show</CODE> subcommands, all of which are
exceptional in lacking corresponding <CODE>set</CODE> commands:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>show version</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX30"></A>
 
Show what version of GDB is running.  You should include this
information in GDB bug-reports.  If multiple versions of GDB are in
use at your site, you may occasionally want to determine which version
of GDB you are running; as GDB evolves, new commands are introduced,
and old ones may wither away.  The version number is also announced
when you start GDB.

<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<DT><CODE>show copying</CODE>
<DD>
Display information about permission for copying GDB.

<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
<DT><CODE>show warranty</CODE>
<DD>
Display the GNU "NO WARRANTY" statement.
</DL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC15">Running Programs Under GDB</A></H1>

<P>
When you run a program under GDB, you must first generate
debugging information when you compile it.
You may start GDB with its arguments, if any, in an environment 
of your choice.  You may redirect your program's input and output, debug an
already running process, or kill a child process.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC16">Compiling for debugging</A></H2>

<P>
In order to debug a program effectively, you need to generate
debugging information when you compile it.  This debugging information
is stored in the object file; it describes the data type of each
variable or function and the correspondence between source line numbers
and addresses in the executable code.

</P>
<P>
To request debugging information, specify the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> option when you run
the compiler.

</P>
<P>
Many C compilers are unable to handle the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>
options together.  Using those compilers, you cannot generate optimized
executables containing debugging information.

</P>
<P>
GCC, the GNU C compiler, supports <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> with or without
<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, making it possible to debug optimized code.  We recommend
that you <EM>always</EM> use <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> whenever you compile a program.
You may think your program is correct, but there is no sense in pushing
your luck.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
When you debug a program compiled with <SAMP>`-g -O'</SAMP>, remember that the
optimizer is rearranging your code; the debugger shows you what is
really there.  Do not be too surprised when the execution path does not
exactly match your source file!  An extreme example: if you define a
variable, but never use it, GDB never sees that
variable--because the compiler optimizes it out of existence.

</P>
<P>
Some things do not work as well with <SAMP>`-g -O'</SAMP> as with just
<SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>, particularly on machines with instruction scheduling.  If in
doubt, recompile with <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> alone, and if this fixes the problem,
please report it to us as a bug (including a test case!).

</P>
<P>
Older versions of the GNU C compiler permitted a variant option
<SAMP>`-gg'</SAMP> for debugging information.  GDB no longer supports this
format; if your GNU C compiler has this option, do not use it.

<DD>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
 
<DT><CODE>r</CODE>

Use the <CODE>run</CODE> command to start your program under GDB.  You must
first specify the program name
(except on VxWorks)
with an argument to GDB (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC5">Getting In and Out of GDB</A>), or by using the <CODE>file</CODE> or <CODE>exec-file</CODE>
command (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC99">Commands to specify files</A>).

</DL>

<P>
If you are running your program in an execution environment that

that process run your program.  (In environments without processes,
<CODE>run</CODE> jumps to the start of your program.)

</P>
<P>
The execution of a program is affected by certain information it
receives from its superior.  GDB provides ways to specify this
information, which you must do <EM>before</EM> starting your program.  (You
can change it after starting your program, but such changes only affect
your program the next time you start it.)  This information may be
divided into four categories:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>The <EM>arguments.</EM>
<DD>
Specify the arguments to give your program as the arguments of the
<CODE>run</CODE> command.  If a shell is available on your target, the shell
is used to pass the arguments, so that you may use normal conventions
(such as wildcard expansion or variable substitution) in describing
the arguments.  In Unix systems, you can control which shell is used
with the <CODE>SHELL</CODE> environment variable. See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC18">Your program's arguments</A>.

<DT>The <EM>environment.</EM>
<DD>
Your program normally inherits its environment from GDB, but you can
use the GDB commands <CODE>set environment</CODE> and <CODE>unset
environment</CODE> to change parts of the environment that affect
your program.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC19">Your program's environment</A>.

<DT>The <EM>working directory.</EM>
<DD>
Your program inherits its working directory from GDB.  You can set
the GDB working directory with the <CODE>cd</CODE> command in GDB.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC20">Your program's working directory</A>.

<DT>The <EM>standard input and output.</EM>
<DD>
Your program normally uses the same device for standard input and
standard output as GDB is using.  You can redirect input and output
in the <CODE>run</CODE> command line, or you can use the <CODE>tty</CODE> command to
set a different device for your program.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC21">Your program's input and output</A>.

<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<EM>Warning:</EM> While input and output redirection work, you cannot use
pipes to pass the output of the program you are debugging to another
program; if you attempt this, GDB is likely to wind up debugging the
wrong program.
</DL>

<P>
When you issue the <CODE>run</CODE> command, your program begins to execute
immediately.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC27">Stopping and Continuing</A>, for discussion
of how to arrange for your program to stop.  Once your program has
stopped, you may call functions in your program, using the <CODE>print</CODE>
or <CODE>call</CODE> commands.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC51">Examining Data</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the modification time of your symbol file has changed since the last
time GDB read its symbols, GDB discards its symbol
table, and reads it again.  When it does this, GDB tries to retain
your current breakpoints.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC18">Your program's arguments</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
The arguments to your program can be specified by the arguments of the
<CODE>run</CODE> command.  They are passed to a shell, which expands wildcard
characters and performs redirection of I/O, and thence to your program.
Your <CODE>SHELL</CODE> environment variable (if it exists) specifies what
shell GDB uses.  If you do not define <CODE>SHELL</CODE>,
GDB uses <CODE>/bin/sh</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>run</CODE> with no arguments uses the same arguments used by the previous
<CODE>run</CODE>, or those set by the <CODE>set args</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set args</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the arguments to be used the next time your program is run.  If
<CODE>set args</CODE> has no arguments, <CODE>run</CODE> executes your program
with no arguments.  Once you have run your program with arguments,
using <CODE>set args</CODE> before the next <CODE>run</CODE> is the only way to run
it again without arguments.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
The <STRONG>environment</STRONG> consists of a set of environment variables and
their values.  Environment variables conventionally record such things as
your user name, your home directory, your terminal type, and your search
path for programs to run.  Usually you set up environment variables with

You may specify several directory names, separated by <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> or
whitespace.  If <VAR>directory</VAR> is already in the path, it is moved to
the front, so it is searched sooner.

You can use the string <SAMP>`$cwd'</SAMP> to refer to whatever is the current
working directory at the time GDB searches the path.  If you
use <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> instead, it refers to the directory where you executed the

Set environment variable <VAR>varname</VAR> to <VAR>value</VAR>.  The value
changes for your program only, not for GDB itself.  <VAR>value</VAR> may
be any string; the values of environment variables are just strings, and
any interpretation is supplied by your program itself.  The <VAR>value</VAR>
parameter is optional; if it is eliminated, the variable is set to a
null value.

For example, this command:


<PRE>
set env USER = foo
</PRE>

tells a Unix program, when subsequently run, that its user is named
<SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>.  (The spaces around <SAMP>`='</SAMP> are used for clarity here; they
are not actually required.)

<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
<DT><CODE>unset environment <VAR>varname</VAR></CODE>

Remove variable <VAR>varname</VAR> from the environment to be passed to your

<CODE>unset environment</CODE> removes the variable from the environment,
rather than assigning it an empty value.

<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> GDB runs your program using the shell indicated
by your <CODE>SHELL</CODE> environment variable if it exists (or

that runs an initialization file--such as <TT>`.cshrc'</TT> for C-shell, or
<TT>`.bashrc'</TT> for BASH--any variables you set in that file affect
your program.  You may wish to move setting of environment variables to

The GDB working directory is initially whatever it inherited
from its parent process (typically the shell), but you can specify a new
working directory in GDB with the <CODE>cd</CODE> command.

</P>

The GDB working directory also serves as a default for the commands

<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
By default, the program you run under GDB does input and output to
the same terminal that GDB uses.  GDB switches the terminal 
to its own terminal modes to interact with you, but it records the terminal
modes your program was using and switches back to them when you continue
running your program.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>info terminal</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
 
Displays information recorded by GDB about the terminal modes your
program is using.
</DL>

<P>
You can redirect your program's input and/or output using shell
redirection with the <CODE>run</CODE> command.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
run &#62; outfile
</PRE>

<P>
starts your program, diverting its output to the file <TT>`outfile'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
Another way to specify where your program should do input and output is
with the <CODE>tty</CODE> command.  This command accepts a file name as
argument, and causes this file to be the default for future <CODE>run</CODE>
commands.  It also resets the controlling terminal for the child
process, for future <CODE>run</CODE> commands.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
tty /dev/ttyb
</PRE>

<P>
directs that processes started with subsequent <CODE>run</CODE> commands
default to do input and output on the terminal <TT>`/dev/ttyb'</TT> and have
that as their controlling terminal.

</P>
<P>
An explicit redirection in <CODE>run</CODE> overrides the <CODE>tty</CODE> command's
effect on the input/output device, but not its effect on the controlling
terminal.

</P>
<P>
When you use the <CODE>tty</CODE> command or redirect input in the <CODE>run</CODE>

This command attaches to a running process--one that was started

find out the process-id of a Unix process is with the <CODE>ps</CODE> utility,

<CODE>attach</CODE> does not repeat if you press <KBD>RET</KBD> a second time after
executing the command.
</DL>

<P>
To use <CODE>attach</CODE>, your program must be running in an environment
which supports processes; for example, <CODE>attach</CODE> does not work for
programs on bare-board targets that lack an operating system.  You must
also have permission to send the process a signal.

</P>
<P>
When using <CODE>attach</CODE>, you should first use the <CODE>file</CODE> command
to specify the program running in the process and load its symbol table.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC99">Commands to specify files</A>.

</P>
<P>
The first thing GDB does after arranging to debug the specified
process is to stop it.  You can examine and modify an attached process
with all the GDB commands that are ordinarily available when you start
processes with <CODE>run</CODE>.  You can insert breakpoints; you can step and
continue; you can modify storage.  If you would rather the process
continue running, you may use the <CODE>continue</CODE> command after
attaching GDB to the process.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>detach</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
 
When you have finished debugging the attached process, you can use the
<CODE>detach</CODE> command to release it from GDB control.  Detaching
the process continues its execution.  After the <CODE>detach</CODE> command,
that process and GDB become completely independent once more, and you
are ready to <CODE>attach</CODE> another process or start one with <CODE>run</CODE>.
<CODE>detach</CODE> does not repeat if you press <KBD>RET</KBD> again after
executing the command.
</DL>

<P>
If you exit GDB or use the <CODE>run</CODE> command while you have an
attached process, you kill that process.  By default, GDB asks
for confirmation if you try to do either of these things; you can
control whether or not you need to confirm by using the <CODE>set
confirm</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC144">Optional warnings and messages</A>).

Kill the child process in which your program is running under GDB.

<P>
This command is useful if you wish to debug a core dump instead of a
running process.  GDB ignores any core dump file while your program
is running.

</P>
<P>
On some operating systems, a program cannot be executed outside GDB
while you have breakpoints set on it inside GDB.  You can use the
<CODE>kill</CODE> command in this situation to permit running your program
outside the debugger.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>kill</CODE> command is also useful if you wish to recompile and
relink your program, since on many systems it is impossible to modify an
executable file while it is running in a process.  In this case, when you
next type <CODE>run</CODE>, GDB notices that the file has changed, and
reads the symbol table again (while trying to preserve your current

<A NAME="IDX68"></A>
<A NAME="IDX69"></A>
<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
In some operating systems, a single program may have more than one
<STRONG>thread</STRONG> of execution.  The precise semantics of threads differ from
one operating system to another, but in general the threads of a single
program are akin to multiple processes--except that they share one
address space (that is, they can all examine and modify the same
variables).  On the other hand, each thread has its own registers and
execution stack, and perhaps private memory.

</P>
<P>
GDB provides these facilities for debugging multi-thread
programs:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>automatic notification of new threads

<LI><SAMP>`thread <VAR>threadno</VAR>'</SAMP>, a command to switch among threads

<LI><SAMP>`info threads'</SAMP>, a command to inquire about existing threads

<LI><SAMP>`thread apply [<VAR>threadno</VAR>] [<VAR>all</VAR>] <VAR>args</VAR>'</SAMP>,

a command to apply a command to a list of threads
<LI>thread-specific breakpoints

</UL>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> These facilities are not yet available on every
GDB configuration where the operating system supports threads.
If your GDB does not support threads, these commands have no
effect.  For example, a system without thread support shows no output
from <SAMP>`info threads'</SAMP>, and always rejects the <CODE>thread</CODE> command,
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) info threads
(gdb) thread 1
Thread ID 1 not known.  Use the "info threads" command to
see the IDs of currently known threads.
</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
The GDB thread debugging facility allows you to observe all
threads while your program runs--but whenever GDB takes
control, one thread in particular is always the focus of debugging.
This thread is called the <STRONG>current thread</STRONG>.  Debugging commands show
program information from the perspective of the current thread.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
Whenever GDB detects a new thread in your program, it displays
the target system's identification for the thread with a message in the
form <SAMP>`[New <VAR>systag</VAR>]'</SAMP>.  <VAR>systag</VAR> is a thread identifier
whose form varies depending on the particular system.  For example, on
LynxOS, you might see

</P>

<PRE>
[New process 35 thread 27]
</PRE>

<P>
when GDB notices a new thread.  In contrast, on an SGI system,
the <VAR>systag</VAR> is simply something like <SAMP>`process 368'</SAMP>, with no
further qualifier.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>

<LI>the current stack frame summary for that thread

</OL>

An asterisk <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> to the left of the GDB thread number

you selected, and its current stack frame summary:


<PRE>
(gdb) thread 2

0x34e5 in sigpause ()
</PRE>

As with the <SAMP>`[New ...]'</SAMP> message, the form of the text after

threads.  

<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
<DT><CODE>thread apply [<VAR>threadno</VAR>] [<VAR>all</VAR>]  <VAR>args</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>thread apply</CODE> command allows you to apply a command to one or
more threads.  Specify the numbers of the threads that you want affected
with the command argument <VAR>threadno</VAR>.  <VAR>threadno</VAR> is the internal
GDB thread number, as shown in the first field of the <SAMP>`info

GDB has no special support for debugging programs which create
additional processes using the <CODE>fork</CODE> function.  When a program
forks, GDB will continue to debug the parent process and the
child process will run unimpeded.  If you have set a breakpoint in any
code which the child then executes, the child will get a <CODE>SIGTRAP</CODE>
signal which (unless it catches the signal) will cause it to terminate.

</P>
<P>
However, if you want to debug the child process there is a workaround
which isn't too painful.  Put a call to <CODE>sleep</CODE> in the code which
the child process executes after the fork.  It may be useful to sleep
only if a certain environment variable is set, or a certain file exists,
so that the delay need not occur when you don't want to run GDB
on the child.  While the child is sleeping, use the <CODE>ps</CODE> program to
get its process ID.  Then tell GDB (a new invocation of
GDB if you are also debugging the parent process) to attach to
the child process (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC22">Debugging an already-running process</A>).  From that point on you can debug
the child process just like any other process which you attached to.

<P>
Inside GDB, your program may stop for any of several reasons, such
as
a signal,
a breakpoint, or reaching a new line after a GDB
command such as <CODE>step</CODE>.  You may then examine and change
variables, set new breakpoints or remove old ones, and then continue
execution.  Usually, the messages shown by GDB provide ample

A <STRONG>breakpoint</STRONG> makes your program stop whenever a certain point in

conditions to control in finer detail whether your program stops.
You can set breakpoints with the <CODE>break</CODE> command and its variants
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC29">Setting breakpoints</A>), to specify the place where
your program should stop by line number, function name or exact address
in the program.  
In languages with exception handling (such as GNU C++), you can also set
breakpoints where an exception is raised (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC31">Breakpoints and exceptions</A>).

A <STRONG>watchpoint</STRONG> is a special breakpoint that stops your program
when the value of an expression changes.  You must use a different
command to set watchpoints (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC30">Setting watchpoints</A>), but aside from that, you can manage a watchpoint like
any other breakpoint: you enable, disable, and delete both breakpoints
and watchpoints using the same commands.

GDB assigns a number to each breakpoint or watchpoint when you
create it; these numbers are successive integers starting with one.  In
many of the commands for controlling various features of breakpoints you

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>break <VAR>function</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a breakpoint at entry to function <VAR>function</VAR>.  
When using source languages that permit overloading of symbols, such as
C++, <VAR>function</VAR> may refer to more than one possible place to break.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC36">Breakpoint menus</A>, for a discussion of that situation.

<DT><CODE>break +<VAR>offset</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>break -<VAR>offset</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a breakpoint some number of lines forward or back from the position
at which execution stopped in the currently selected frame.

<DT><CODE>break <VAR>linenum</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a breakpoint at line <VAR>linenum</VAR> in the current source file.
That file is the last file whose source text was printed.  This
breakpoint stops your program just before it executes any of the
code on that line.

<DT><CODE>break <VAR>filename</VAR>:<VAR>linenum</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a breakpoint at line <VAR>linenum</VAR> in source file <VAR>filename</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>break <VAR>filename</VAR>:<VAR>function</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a breakpoint at entry to function <VAR>function</VAR> found in file
<VAR>filename</VAR>.  Specifying a file name as well as a function name is
superfluous except when multiple files contain similarly named
functions.

<DT><CODE>break *<VAR>address</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a breakpoint at address <VAR>address</VAR>.  You can use this to set
breakpoints in parts of your program which do not have debugging
information or source files.

<DT><CODE>break</CODE>
<DD>
When called without any arguments, <CODE>break</CODE> sets a breakpoint at
the next instruction to be executed in the selected stack frame
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC40">Examining the Stack</A>).  In any selected frame but the
innermost, this makes your program stop as soon as control
returns to that frame.  This is similar to the effect of a
<CODE>finish</CODE> command in the frame inside the selected frame--except
that <CODE>finish</CODE> does not leave an active breakpoint.  If you use
<CODE>break</CODE> without an argument in the innermost frame, GDB stops
the next time it reaches the current location; this may be useful
inside loops.

GDB normally ignores breakpoints when it resumes execution, until at
least one instruction has been executed.  If it did not do this, you
would be unable to proceed past a breakpoint without first disabling the
breakpoint.  This rule applies whether or not the breakpoint already
existed when your program stopped.

<DT><CODE>break ... if <VAR>cond</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a breakpoint with condition <VAR>cond</VAR>; evaluate the expression
<VAR>cond</VAR> each time the breakpoint is reached, and stop only if the
value is nonzero--that is, if <VAR>cond</VAR> evaluates as true.
<SAMP>`...'</SAMP> stands for one of the possible arguments described
above (or no argument) specifying where to break.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC34">Break conditions</A>, for more information on breakpoint conditions.

<A NAME="IDX98"></A>
<DT><CODE>tbreak <VAR>args</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a breakpoint enabled only for one stop.  <VAR>args</VAR> are the
same as for the <CODE>break</CODE> command, and the breakpoint is set in the same
way, but the breakpoint is automatically deleted after the first time your
program stops there.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC33">Disabling breakpoints</A>.

<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
<DT><CODE>hbreak <VAR>args</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a hardware-assisted breakpoint.  <VAR>args</VAR> are the same as for the 
<CODE>break</CODE> command and the breakpoint is set in the same way, but the 
breakpoint requires hardware support and some target hardware may not
have this support.  The main purpose of this is EPROM/ROM code
debugging, so you can set a breakpoint at an instruction without 
changing the instruction.  This can be used with the new trap-generation 
provided by SPARClite DSU.  DSU will generate traps when a program accesses
some date or instruction address that is assigned to the debug registers.  
However the hardware breakpoint registers can only take two data breakpoints,
and GDB will reject this command if more than two are used.  
Delete or disable usused hardware breakpoints before setting
new ones.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC34">Break conditions</A>.

<A NAME="IDX100"></A>
<DT><CODE>thbreak <VAR>args</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a hardware-assisted breakpoint enabled only for one stop.  <VAR>args</VAR>
are the same as for the <CODE>hbreak</CODE> command and the breakpoint is set in
the same way.  However, like the <CODE>tbreak</CODE> command,  
the breakpoint is automatically deleted after the
first time your program stops there.  Also, like the <CODE>hbreak</CODE>
command, the breakpoint requires hardware support and some target hardware 
may not have this support.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC33">Disabling breakpoints</A>.  
Also See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC34">Break conditions</A>.

<A NAME="IDX101"></A>
<A NAME="IDX102"></A>
<DT><CODE>rbreak <VAR>regex</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set breakpoints on all functions matching the regular expression
<VAR>regex</VAR>.  This command
sets an unconditional breakpoint on all matches, printing a list of all
breakpoints it set.  Once these breakpoints are set, they are treated
just like the breakpoints set with the <CODE>break</CODE> command.  You can
delete them, disable them, or make them conditional the same way as any
other breakpoint.

When debugging C++ programs, <CODE>rbreak</CODE> is useful for setting

If a breakpoint is conditional, <CODE>info break</CODE> shows the condition on
the line following the affected breakpoint; breakpoint commands, if any,
are listed after that.

<CODE>info break</CODE> with a breakpoint
number <VAR>n</VAR> as argument lists only that breakpoint.  The
convenience variable <CODE>$_</CODE> and the default examining-address for
the <CODE>x</CODE> command are set to the address of the last breakpoint
listed (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC56">Examining memory</A>).  

<CODE>info break</CODE> now displays a count of the number of times the
breakpoint has been hit.  This is especially useful in conjunction with
the <CODE>ignore</CODE> command.  You can ignore a large number of breakpoint
hits, look at the breakpoint info to see how many times the
breakpoint was hit, and then run again, ignoring one less than that
number.  This will get you quickly to the last hit of that breakpoint.

GDB allows you to set any number of breakpoints at the same place in

<P>
<A NAME="IDX108"></A>

</P>
<P>
You can use a watchpoint to stop execution whenever the value of an
expression changes, without having to predict a particular place
where this may happen.

</P>
<P>
Watchpoints currently execute two orders of magnitude more slowly than
other breakpoints, but this can be well worth it to catch errors where
you have no clue what part of your program is the culprit.

</P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>watch <VAR>expr</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX109"></A>
 
Set a watchpoint for an expression.  GDB will break when <VAR>expr</VAR>
is written into by the program and its value changes.
This can be used with the new trap-generation provided by 
SPARClite DSU.  DSU will generate traps when a program accesses
some date or instruction address that is assigned to the debug registers.  
For the data addresses, DSU facilitates the <CODE>watch</CODE> command.
However the hardware breakpoint registers can only take two data watchpoints,
and both watchpoints must be the same kind.  For example, you can set two
watchpoints with <CODE>watch</CODE> commands, two with <CODE>rwatch</CODE>
commands, <STRONG>or</STRONG> two with <CODE>awatch</CODE> commands, but you cannot set one
watchpoint with one command and the other with a different command. 
 will reject the command if you try to mix watchpoints.
Delete or disable unused watchpoint commands before setting new ones.

<A NAME="IDX110"></A>
<DT><CODE>rwatch <VAR>expr</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a watchpoint that will break when watch <VAR>args</VAR> is read by the program.
If you use both watchpoints, both must be set with the <CODE>rwatch</CODE>
command.

<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
<DT><CODE>awatch <VAR>expr</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a watchpoint that will break when <VAR>args</VAR> is read and written into
by the program.  If you use both watchpoints, both must be set with the
<CODE>awatch</CODE> command.

<A NAME="IDX112"></A>
<DT><CODE>info watchpoints</CODE>

This command prints a list of watchpoints and breakpoints; it is the

<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> in multi-thread programs, watchpoints have only limited
usefulness.  With the current watchpoint implementation, GDB
can only watch the value of an expression <EM>in a single thread</EM>.  If
you are confident that the expression can only change due to the current
thread's activity (and if you are also confident that no other thread
can become current), then you can use watchpoints as usual.  However,
GDB may not notice when a non-current thread's activity changes
the expression.

<H3><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC31">Breakpoints and exceptions</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>

</P>
<P>
Some languages, such as GNU C++, implement exception handling.  You can
use GDB to examine what caused your program to raise an exception,
and to list the exceptions your program is prepared to handle at a
given point in time.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>catch <VAR>exceptions</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
 
You can set breakpoints at active exception handlers by using the
<CODE>catch</CODE> command.  <VAR>exceptions</VAR> is a list of names of exceptions
to catch.
</DL>

<P>
You can use <CODE>info catch</CODE> to list active exception handlers.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC44">Information about a frame</A>.

</P>
<P>
There are currently some limitations to exception handling in GDB:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you call a function interactively, GDB normally returns
control to you when the function has finished executing.  If the call
raises an exception, however, the call may bypass the mechanism that
returns control to you and cause your program to simply continue
running until it hits a breakpoint, catches a signal that GDB is
listening for, or exits.

<LI>

You cannot raise an exception interactively.

<LI>

You cannot install an exception handler interactively.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX117"></A>
Sometimes <CODE>catch</CODE> is not the best way to debug exception handling:
if you need to know exactly where an exception is raised, it is better to
stop <EM>before</EM> the exception handler is called, since that way you
can see the stack before any unwinding takes place.  If you set a
breakpoint in an exception handler instead, it may not be easy to find
out where the exception was raised.

</P>
<P>
To stop just before an exception handler is called, you need some
knowledge of the implementation.  In the case of GNU C++, exceptions are
raised by calling a library function named <CODE>__raise_exception</CODE>
which has the following ANSI C interface:

</P>

<PRE>
    /* <VAR>addr</VAR> is where the exception identifier is stored.
       ID is the exception identifier.  */
    void __raise_exception (void **<VAR>addr</VAR>, void *<VAR>id</VAR>);
</PRE>

<P>
To make the debugger catch all exceptions before any stack
unwinding takes place, set a breakpoint on <CODE>__raise_exception</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC28">Breakpoints, watchpoints, and exceptions</A>).

</P>
<P>
With a conditional breakpoint (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC34">Break conditions</A>)
that depends on the value of <VAR>id</VAR>, you can stop your program when
a specific exception is raised.  You can use multiple conditional
breakpoints to stop your program when any of a number of exceptions are
raised.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC32">Deleting breakpoints</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
It is often necessary to eliminate a breakpoint or watchpoint once it
has done its job and you no longer want your program to stop there.  This
is called <STRONG>deleting</STRONG> the breakpoint.  A breakpoint that has been
deleted no longer exists; it is forgotten.

</P>
<P>
With the <CODE>clear</CODE> command you can delete breakpoints according to
where they are in your program.  With the <CODE>delete</CODE> command you can
delete individual breakpoints or watchpoints by specifying their
breakpoint numbers.

</P>
<P>
It is not necessary to delete a breakpoint to proceed past it.  GDB
automatically ignores breakpoints on the first instruction to be executed
when you continue execution without changing the execution address.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>clear</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
Delete any breakpoints at the next instruction to be executed in the
selected stack frame (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC43">Selecting a frame</A>).  When
the innermost frame is selected, this is a good way to delete a
breakpoint where your program just stopped.

<DT><CODE>clear <VAR>function</VAR></CODE>

<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<DT><CODE>delete [breakpoints] [<VAR>bnums</VAR>...]</CODE>
<DD>
Delete the breakpoints or watchpoints of the numbers specified as

asks confirmation, unless you have <CODE>set confirm off</CODE>).  You
can abbreviate this command as <CODE>d</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC33">Disabling breakpoints</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
Rather than deleting a breakpoint or watchpoint, you might prefer to
<STRONG>disable</STRONG> it.  This makes the breakpoint inoperative as if it had
been deleted, but remembers the information on the breakpoint so that
you can <STRONG>enable</STRONG> it again later.

</P>
<P>
You disable and enable breakpoints and watchpoints with the
<CODE>enable</CODE> and <CODE>disable</CODE> commands, optionally specifying one or
more breakpoint numbers as arguments.  Use <CODE>info break</CODE> or
<CODE>info watch</CODE> to print a list of breakpoints or watchpoints if you
do not know which numbers to use.

</P>
<P>
A breakpoint or watchpoint can have any of four different states of
enablement:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Enabled.  The breakpoint stops your program.  A breakpoint set
with the <CODE>break</CODE> command starts out in this state.
<LI>

Disabled.  The breakpoint has no effect on your program.
<LI>

Enabled once.  The breakpoint stops your program, but then becomes
disabled.  A breakpoint set with the <CODE>tbreak</CODE> command starts out in
this state.
<LI>

Enabled for deletion.  The breakpoint stops your program, but
immediately after it does so it is deleted permanently.
</UL>

<P>
You can use the following commands to enable or disable breakpoints and
watchpoints:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>disable [breakpoints] [<VAR>bnums</VAR>...]</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX127"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX128"></A>
 
Disable the specified breakpoints--or all breakpoints, if none are
listed.  A disabled breakpoint has no effect but is not forgotten.  All
options such as ignore-counts, conditions and commands are remembered in
case the breakpoint is enabled again later.  You may abbreviate
<CODE>disable</CODE> as <CODE>dis</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
<DT><CODE>enable [breakpoints] [<VAR>bnums</VAR>...]</CODE>
<DD>
Enable the specified breakpoints (or all defined breakpoints).  They
become effective once again in stopping your program.

<DT><CODE>enable [breakpoints] once <VAR>bnums</VAR>...</CODE>
<DD>
Enable the specified breakpoints temporarily.  GDB disables any
of these breakpoints immediately after stopping your program.

<DT><CODE>enable [breakpoints] delete <VAR>bnums</VAR>...</CODE>
<DD>
Enable the specified breakpoints to work once, then die.  GDB
deletes any of these breakpoints as soon as your program stops there.
</DL>

<P>
Except for a breakpoint set with <CODE>tbreak</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC29">Setting breakpoints</A>), breakpoints that you set are initially enabled;
subsequently, they become disabled or enabled only when you use one of
the commands above.  (The command <CODE>until</CODE> can set and delete a
breakpoint of its own, but it does not change the state of your other
breakpoints; see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC37">Continuing and stepping</A>.)

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC34">Break conditions</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
<A NAME="IDX132"></A>

</P>
<P>
The simplest sort of breakpoint breaks every time your program reaches a
specified place.  You can also specify a <STRONG>condition</STRONG> for a
breakpoint.  A condition is just a Boolean expression in your
programming language (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>).  A breakpoint with
a condition evaluates the expression each time your program reaches it,
and your program stops only if the condition is <EM>true</EM>.

</P>
<P>
This is the converse of using assertions for program validation; in that
situation, you want to stop when the assertion is violated--that is,
when the condition is false.  In C, if you want to test an assertion expressed
by the condition <VAR>assert</VAR>, you should set the condition
<SAMP>`! <VAR>assert</VAR>'</SAMP> on the appropriate breakpoint.

</P>
<P>
Conditions are also accepted for watchpoints; you may not need them,
since a watchpoint is inspecting the value of an expression anyhow--but
it might be simpler, say, to just set a watchpoint on a variable name,
and specify a condition that tests whether the new value is an interesting
one.

</P>
<P>
Break conditions can have side effects, and may even call functions in
your program.  This can be useful, for example, to activate functions
that log program progress, or to use your own print functions to
format special data structures. The effects are completely predictable
unless there is another enabled breakpoint at the same address.  (In
that case, GDB might see the other breakpoint first and stop your
program without checking the condition of this one.)  Note that
breakpoint commands are usually more convenient and flexible for the
purpose of performing side effects when a breakpoint is reached
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC35">Breakpoint command lists</A>).

</P>
<P>
Break conditions can be specified when a breakpoint is set, by using
<SAMP>`if'</SAMP> in the arguments to the <CODE>break</CODE> command.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC29">Setting breakpoints</A>.  They can also be changed at any time
with the <CODE>condition</CODE> command.  The <CODE>watch</CODE> command does not
recognize the <CODE>if</CODE> keyword; <CODE>condition</CODE> is the only way to
impose a further condition on a watchpoint.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>condition <VAR>bnum</VAR> <VAR>expression</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX133"></A>
 
Specify <VAR>expression</VAR> as the break condition for breakpoint or
watchpoint number <VAR>bnum</VAR>.  After you set a condition, breakpoint
<VAR>bnum</VAR> stops your program only if the value of <VAR>expression</VAR> is
true (nonzero, in C).  When you use <CODE>condition</CODE>, GDB
checks <VAR>expression</VAR> immediately for syntactic correctness, and to
determine whether symbols in it have referents in the context of your
breakpoint.
GDB does
not actually evaluate <VAR>expression</VAR> at the time the <CODE>condition</CODE>
command is given, however.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>.

<DT><CODE>condition <VAR>bnum</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Remove the condition from breakpoint number <VAR>bnum</VAR>.  It becomes
an ordinary unconditional breakpoint.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX134"></A>
A special case of a breakpoint condition is to stop only when the
breakpoint has been reached a certain number of times.  This is so
useful that there is a special way to do it, using the <STRONG>ignore
count</STRONG> of the breakpoint.  Every breakpoint has an ignore count, which
is an integer.  Most of the time, the ignore count is zero, and
therefore has no effect.  But if your program reaches a breakpoint whose
ignore count is positive, then instead of stopping, it just decrements
the ignore count by one and continues.  As a result, if the ignore count
value is <VAR>n</VAR>, the breakpoint does not stop the next <VAR>n</VAR> times
your program reaches it.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ignore <VAR>bnum</VAR> <VAR>count</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX135"></A>
 
Set the ignore count of breakpoint number <VAR>bnum</VAR> to <VAR>count</VAR>.
The next <VAR>count</VAR> times the breakpoint is reached, your program's
execution does not stop; other than to decrement the ignore count, GDB
takes no action.

To make the breakpoint stop the next time it is reached, specify
a count of zero.

When you use <CODE>continue</CODE> to resume execution of your program from a
breakpoint, you can specify an ignore count directly as an argument to
<CODE>continue</CODE>, rather than using <CODE>ignore</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC37">Continuing and stepping</A>.

If a breakpoint has a positive ignore count and a condition, the
condition is not checked.  Once the ignore count reaches zero,
GDB resumes checking the condition.

You could achieve the effect of the ignore count with a condition such
as <SAMP>`$foo-- &#60;= 0'</SAMP> using a debugger convenience variable that
is decremented each time.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC60">Convenience variables</A>.

<CODE>end</CODE> to terminate the commands.

To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type <CODE>commands</CODE> and
follow it immediately with <CODE>end</CODE>; that is, give no commands.

With no <VAR>bnum</VAR> argument, <CODE>commands</CODE> refers to the last
breakpoint or watchpoint set (not to the breakpoint most recently
encountered).
</DL>

<P>
Pressing <KBD>RET</KBD> as a means of repeating the last GDB command is
disabled within a <VAR>command-list</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up again.  Simply
use the <CODE>continue</CODE> command, or <CODE>step</CODE>, or any other command
that resumes execution.

</P>
<P>
Any other commands in the command list, after a command that resumes
execution, are ignored.  This is because any time you resume execution
(even with a simple <CODE>next</CODE> or <CODE>step</CODE>), you may encounter
another breakpoint--which could have its own command list, leading to
ambiguities about which list to execute.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
If the first command you specify in a command list is <CODE>silent</CODE>, the
usual message about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed.  This may
be desirable for breakpoints that are to print a specific message and
then continue.  If none of the remaining commands print anything, you
see no sign that the breakpoint was reached.  <CODE>silent</CODE> is
meaningful only at the beginning of a breakpoint command list.

</P>
<P>
The commands <CODE>echo</CODE>, <CODE>output</CODE>, and <CODE>printf</CODE> allow you to
print precisely controlled output, and are often useful in silent
breakpoints.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC149">Commands for controlled output</A>.

</P>
<P>
For example, here is how you could use breakpoint commands to print the
value of <CODE>x</CODE> at entry to <CODE>foo</CODE> whenever <CODE>x</CODE> is positive.

</P>

<PRE>
break foo if x&#62;0
commands
silent
printf "x is %d\n",x
cont
end
</PRE>

<P>
One application for breakpoint commands is to compensate for one bug so
you can test for another.  Put a breakpoint just after the erroneous line
of code, give it a condition to detect the case in which something
erroneous has been done, and give it commands to assign correct values
to any variables that need them.  End with the <CODE>continue</CODE> command
so that your program does not stop, and start with the <CODE>silent</CODE>
command so that no output is produced.  Here is an example:

break 403

Some programming languages (notably C++) permit a single function name
to be defined several times, for application in different contexts.
This is called <STRONG>overloading</STRONG>.  When a function name is overloaded,
<SAMP>`break <VAR>function</VAR>'</SAMP> is not enough to tell GDB where you want
a breakpoint.  If you realize this is a problem, you can use
something like <SAMP>`break <VAR>function</VAR>(<VAR>types</VAR>)'</SAMP> to specify which
particular version of the function you want.  Otherwise, GDB offers
you a menu of numbered choices for different possible breakpoints, and
waits for your selection with the prompt <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP>.  The first two
options are always <SAMP>`[0] cancel'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`[1] all'</SAMP>.  Typing <KBD>1</KBD>
sets a breakpoint at each definition of <VAR>function</VAR>, and typing
<KBD>0</KBD> aborts the <CODE>break</CODE> command without setting any new
breakpoints.

To resume execution at a different place, you can use <CODE>return</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC95">Returning from a function</A>) to go back to the
calling function; or <CODE>jump</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC93">Continuing at a different address</A>) to go to an arbitrary location in your program.

</P>
<P>
A typical technique for using stepping is to set a breakpoint
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC28">Breakpoints, watchpoints, and exceptions</A>)
at the
beginning of the function or the section of your program where a
problem is believed to lie, run your program until it stops at that
breakpoint, and then step through the suspect area, examining the
variables that are interesting, until you see the problem happen.

<DT><CODE>step</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX148"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX149"></A>
 
Continue running your program until control reaches a different source
line, then stop it and return control to GDB.  This command is
abbreviated <CODE>s</CODE>.


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> If you use the <CODE>step</CODE> command while control is
within a function that was compiled without debugging information,
execution proceeds until control reaches a function that does have
debugging information.  Likewise, it will not step into a function which
is compiled without debugging information.  To step through functions
without debugging information, use the <CODE>stepi</CODE> command, described
below.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The <CODE>step</CODE> command now only stops at the first instruction of a
source line.  This prevents the multiple stops that used to occur in
switch statements, for loops, etc.  <CODE>step</CODE> continues to stop if a
function that has debugging information is called within the line.

Also, the <CODE>step</CODE> command now only enters a subroutine if there is line
number information for the subroutine.  Otherwise it acts like the
<CODE>next</CODE> command.  This avoids problems when using <CODE>cc -gl</CODE> 
on MIPS machines.  Previously, <CODE>step</CODE> entered subroutines if there
was any debugging information about the routine.  

<DT><CODE>step <VAR>count</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Continue running as in <CODE>step</CODE>, but do so <VAR>count</VAR> times.  If a
breakpoint is reached,
or a signal not related to stepping occurs before <VAR>count</VAR> steps,
stepping stops right away.

<A NAME="IDX150"></A>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
<DT><CODE>next [<VAR>count</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Continue to the next source line in the current (innermost) stack frame.
This is similar to <CODE>step</CODE>, but function calls that appear within the line
of code are executed without stopping.  Execution stops when control
reaches a different line of code at the original stack level that was 
executing when you gave the <CODE>next</CODE> command.  This command is abbreviated
<CODE>n</CODE>.

An argument <VAR>count</VAR> is a repeat count, as for <CODE>step</CODE>.

The <CODE>next</CODE> command now only stops at the first instruction of a
source line.  This prevents the multiple stops that used to occur in
swtch statements, for loops, etc. 

<A NAME="IDX152"></A>
<DT><CODE>finish</CODE>
<DD>
Continue running until just after function in the selected stack frame
returns.  Print the returned value (if any).

Contrast this with the <CODE>return</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC95">Returning from a function</A>).

<A NAME="IDX153"></A>
<DT><CODE>u</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>
<DT><CODE>until</CODE>
<DD>
Continue running until a source line past the current line, in the
current stack frame, is reached.  This command is used to avoid single
stepping through a loop more than once.  It is like the <CODE>next</CODE>
command, except that when <CODE>until</CODE> encounters a jump, it
automatically continues execution until the program counter is greater
than the address of the jump.

This means that when you reach the end of a loop after single stepping
though it, <CODE>until</CODE> makes your program continue execution until it
exits the loop.  In contrast, a <CODE>next</CODE> command at the end of a loop
simply steps back to the beginning of the loop, which forces you to step
through the next iteration.

<CODE>until</CODE> always stops your program if it attempts to exit the current
stack frame.

<CODE>until</CODE> may produce somewhat counterintuitive results if the order
of machine code does not match the order of the source lines.  For
example, in the following excerpt from a debugging session, the <CODE>f</CODE>
(<CODE>frame</CODE>) command shows that execution is stopped at line
<CODE>206</CODE>; yet when we use <CODE>until</CODE>, we get to line <CODE>195</CODE>:


<PRE>
(gdb) f
#0  main (argc=4, argv=0xf7fffae8) at m4.c:206
206                 expand_input();
(gdb) until
195             for ( ; argc &#62; 0; NEXTARG) {
</PRE>

This happened because, for execution efficiency, the compiler had
generated code for the loop closure test at the end, rather than the
start, of the loop--even though the test in a C <CODE>for</CODE>-loop is
written before the body of the loop.  The <CODE>until</CODE> command appeared
to step back to the beginning of the loop when it advanced to this
expression; however, it has not really gone to an earlier
statement--not in terms of the actual machine code.

<CODE>until</CODE> with no argument works by means of single
instruction stepping, and hence is slower than <CODE>until</CODE> with an
argument.

<DT><CODE>until <VAR>location</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>u <VAR>location</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Continue running your program until either the specified location is
reached, or the current stack frame returns.  <VAR>location</VAR> is any of
the forms of argument acceptable to <CODE>break</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC29">Setting breakpoints</A>).  This form of the command uses breakpoints,
and hence is quicker than <CODE>until</CODE> without an argument.

<DT><CODE>stepi</CODE>

Execute one machine instruction, then stop and return to the debugger.

It is often useful to do <SAMP>`display/i $pc'</SAMP> when stepping by machine
instructions.  This makes GDB automatically display the next
instruction to be executed, each time your program stops.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC57">Automatic display</A>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC38">Signals</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX159"></A>

</P>
<P>
A signal is an asynchronous event that can happen in a program.  The
operating system defines the possible kinds of signals, and gives each
kind a name and a number.  For example, in Unix <CODE>SIGINT</CODE> is the
signal a program gets when you type an interrupt (often <KBD>C-c</KBD>);
<CODE>SIGSEGV</CODE> is the signal a program gets from referencing a place in
memory far away from all the areas in use; <CODE>SIGALRM</CODE> occurs when
the alarm clock timer goes off (which happens only if your program has
requested an alarm).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX160"></A>
Some signals, including <CODE>SIGALRM</CODE>, are a normal part of the
functioning of your program.  Others, such as <CODE>SIGSEGV</CODE>, indicate
errors; these signals are <STRONG>fatal</STRONG> (kill your program immediately) if the
program has not specified in advance some other way to handle the signal.
<CODE>SIGINT</CODE> does not indicate an error in your program, but it is normally
fatal so it can carry out the purpose of the interrupt: to kill the program.

</P>
<P>
GDB has the ability to detect any occurrence of a signal in your
program.  You can tell GDB in advance what to do for each kind of
signal.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>
Normally, GDB is set up to ignore non-erroneous signals like <CODE>SIGALRM</CODE>
(so as not to interfere with their role in the functioning of your program)
but to stop your program immediately whenever an error signal happens.
You can change these settings with the <CODE>handle</CODE> command.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>info signals</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
 
Print a table of all the kinds of signals and how GDB has been told to
handle each one.  You can use this to see the signal numbers of all
the defined types of signals.

<CODE>info handle</CODE> is the new alias for <CODE>info signals</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX163"></A>
<DT><CODE>handle <VAR>signal</VAR> <VAR>keywords</VAR>...</CODE>
<DD>
Change the way GDB handles signal <VAR>signal</VAR>.  <VAR>signal</VAR> can 
be the number of a signal or its name (with or without the <SAMP>`SIG'</SAMP> at the
beginning).  The <VAR>keywords</VAR> say what change to make.
</DL>

<P>
The keywords allowed by the <CODE>handle</CODE> command can be abbreviated.
Their full names are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>nostop</CODE>
<DD>
GDB should not stop your program when this signal happens.  It may
still print a message telling you that the signal has come in.

<DT><CODE>stop</CODE>
<DD>
GDB should stop your program when this signal happens.  This implies
the <CODE>print</CODE> keyword as well.

<DT><CODE>print</CODE>
<DD>
GDB should print a message when this signal happens.

<DT><CODE>noprint</CODE>
<DD>
GDB should not mention the occurrence of the signal at all.  This
implies the <CODE>nostop</CODE> keyword as well.

<DT><CODE>pass</CODE>
<DD>
GDB should allow your program to see this signal; your program
can handle the signal, or else it may terminate if the signal is fatal
and not handled.

<DT><CODE>nopass</CODE>
<DD>
GDB should not allow your program to see this signal.
</DL>

<P>
When a signal stops your program, the signal is not visible until you
continue.  Your program sees the signal then, if <CODE>pass</CODE> is in
effect for the signal in question <EM>at that time</EM>.  In other words,
after GDB reports a signal, you can use the <CODE>handle</CODE>
command with <CODE>pass</CODE> or <CODE>nopass</CODE> to control whether your
program sees that signal when you continue.

</P>
<P>
You can also use the <CODE>signal</CODE> command to prevent your program from
seeing a signal, or cause it to see a signal it normally would not see,
or to give it any signal at any time.  For example, if your program stopped
due to some sort of memory reference error, you might store correct
values into the erroneous variables and continue, hoping to see more
execution; but your program would probably terminate immediately as
a result of the fatal signal once it saw the signal.  To prevent this,
you can continue with <SAMP>`signal 0'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC94">Giving your program a signal</A>. 

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC39">Stopping and starting multi-thread programs</A></H2>

<P>
When your program has multiple threads (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC25">Debugging programs with multiple threads</A>), you can choose whether to set
breakpoints on all threads, or on a particular thread.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>break <VAR>linespec</VAR> thread <VAR>threadno</VAR></CODE>

 <A NAME="IDX166"></A>
 
<DT><CODE>break <VAR>linespec</VAR> thread <VAR>threadno</VAR> if ...</CODE>
<DD>
<VAR>linespec</VAR> specifies source lines; there are several ways of
writing them, but the effect is always to specify some source line.

Use the qualifier <SAMP>`thread <VAR>threadno</VAR>'</SAMP> with a breakpoint command
to specify that you only want GDB to stop the program when a
particular thread reaches this breakpoint.  <VAR>threadno</VAR> is one of the
numeric thread identifiers assigned by GDB, shown in the first
column of the <SAMP>`info threads'</SAMP> display.

If you do not specify <SAMP>`thread <VAR>threadno</VAR>'</SAMP> when you set a
breakpoint, the breakpoint applies to <EM>all</EM> threads of your
program.

You can use the <CODE>thread</CODE> qualifier on conditional breakpoints as
well; in this case, place <SAMP>`thread <VAR>threadno</VAR>'</SAMP> before the
breakpoint condition, like this:

<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>
Whenever your program stops under GDB for any reason,
<EM>all</EM> threads of execution stop, not just the current thread.  This
allows you to examine the overall state of the program, including
switching between threads, without worrying that things may change
underfoot.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX169"></A>
<A NAME="IDX170"></A>
Conversely, whenever you restart the program, <EM>all</EM> threads start
executing.  <EM>This is true even when single-stepping</EM> with commands
like <CODE>step</CODE> or <CODE>next</CODE>.  

</P>
<P>
In particular, GDB cannot single-step all threads in lockstep.
Since thread scheduling is up to your debugging target's operating
system (not controlled by GDB), other threads may
execute more than one statement while the current thread completes a
single step.  Moreover, in general other threads stop in the middle of a
statement, rather than at a clean statement boundary, when the program
stops.

</P>
<P>
You might even find your program stopped in another thread after
continuing or even single-stepping.  This happens whenever some other
thread runs into a breakpoint, a signal, or an exception before the
first thread completes whatever you requested.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC40">Examining the Stack</A></H1>

<P>
When your program has stopped, the first thing you need to know is where it
stopped and how it got there.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX171"></A>
Each time your program performs a function call, information about the call 
is generated. 
That information includes the location of the call in your program, 
the arguments of the call, 
and the local variables of the function being called.
The information is saved in a block of data called a <STRONG>stack frame</STRONG>.  
The stack frames are allocated in a region of memory called the <STRONG>call
stack</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
When your program stops, the GDB commands for examining the
stack allow you to see all of this information.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX172"></A>
One of the stack frames is <STRONG>selected</STRONG> by GDB and many
GDB commands refer implicitly to the selected frame.  In
particular, whenever you ask GDB for the value of a variable in
your program, the value is found in the selected frame.  There are
special GDB commands to select whichever frame you are
interested in. See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC43">Selecting a frame</A>.

</P>
<P>
When your program stops, GDB automatically selects the
currently executing frame and describes it briefly, similar to the 
<CODE>frame</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC44">Information about a frame</A>).

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC41">Stack frames</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX173"></A>
<A NAME="IDX174"></A>
The call stack is divided up into contiguous pieces called <STRONG>stack
frames</STRONG>, or <STRONG>frames</STRONG> for short; each frame is the data associated
with one call to one function.  The frame contains the arguments given
to the function, the function's local variables, and the address at
which the function is executing.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX175"></A>
<A NAME="IDX176"></A>
<A NAME="IDX177"></A>
When your program is started, the stack has only one frame, that of the
function <CODE>main</CODE>.  This is called the <STRONG>initial</STRONG> frame or the
<STRONG>outermost</STRONG> frame.  Each time a function is called, a new frame is
made.  Each time a function returns, the frame for that function invocation
is eliminated.  If a function is recursive, there can be many frames for
the same function.  The frame for the function in which execution is
actually occurring is called the <STRONG>innermost</STRONG> frame.  This is the most
recently created of all the stack frames that still exist.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX178"></A>
Inside your program, stack frames are identified by their addresses.  A
stack frame consists of many bytes, each of which has its own address; each
kind of computer has a convention for choosing one byte whose
address serves as the address of the frame.  Usually this address is kept
in a register called the <STRONG>frame pointer register</STRONG> while execution is
going on in that frame.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX179"></A>
GDB assigns numbers to all existing stack frames, starting with
zero for the innermost frame, one for the frame that called it,
and so on upward.  These numbers do not really exist in your program;
they are assigned by GDB to give you a way of designating stack
frames in GDB commands.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX180"></A>
Some compilers provide a way to compile functions so that they operate
without stack frames.  (For example, the <CODE>gcc</CODE> option
<SAMP>`-fomit-frame-pointer'</SAMP> generates functions without a frame.)
This is occasionally done with heavily used library functions to save
the frame setup time.  GDB has limited facilities for dealing
with these function invocations.  If the innermost function invocation
has no stack frame, GDB nevertheless regards it as though
it had a separate frame, which is numbered zero as usual, allowing
correct tracing of the function call chain.  However, GDB has
no provision for frameless functions elsewhere in the stack.

<DL COMPACT>

<H2><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC43">Selecting a frame</A></H2>

<P>
Most commands for examining the stack and other data in your program work on
whichever stack frame is selected at the moment.  Here are the commands for
selecting a stack frame; all of them finish by printing a brief description
of the stack frame just selected.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>frame <VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX188"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX189"></A>
 
<DT><CODE>f <VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Select frame number <VAR>n</VAR>.  Recall that frame zero is the innermost
(currently executing) frame, frame one is the frame that called the
innermost one, and so on.  The highest-numbered frame is the one for
<CODE>main</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>frame <VAR>addr</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>f <VAR>addr</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Select the frame at address <VAR>addr</VAR>.  This is useful mainly if the
chaining of stack frames has been damaged by a bug, making it
impossible for GDB to assign numbers properly to all frames.  In
addition, this can be useful when your program has multiple stacks and
switches between them.

On the SPARC architecture, <CODE>frame</CODE> needs two addresses to
select an arbitrary frame: a frame pointer and a stack pointer.

On the MIPS and Alpha architecture, it needs two addresses: a stack
pointer and a program counter.

On the 29k architecture, it needs three addresses: a register stack
pointer, a program counter, and a memory stack pointer.

<A NAME="IDX190"></A>
<DT><CODE>up <VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Move <VAR>n</VAR> frames up the stack.  For positive numbers <VAR>n</VAR>, this
advances toward the outermost frame, to higher frame numbers, to frames
that have existed longer.  <VAR>n</VAR> defaults to one.

<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
<A NAME="IDX192"></A>
<DT><CODE>down <VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Move <VAR>n</VAR> frames down the stack.  For positive numbers <VAR>n</VAR>, this
advances toward the innermost frame, to lower frame numbers, to frames
that were created more recently.  <VAR>n</VAR> defaults to one.  You may
abbreviate <CODE>down</CODE> as <CODE>do</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
All of these commands end by printing two lines of output describing the
frame.  The first line shows the frame number, the function name, the
arguments, and the source file and line number of execution in that
frame.  The second line shows the text of that source line.  

</P>
<P>
For example:

</P>

<PRE>

#1  0x22f0 in main (argc=1, argv=0xf7fffbf4, env=0xf7fffbfc)
    at env.c:10
10              read_input_file (argv[i]);
</PRE>

<P>
After such a printout, the <CODE>list</CODE> command with no arguments
prints ten lines centered on the point of execution in the frame.

<DD>
These two commands are variants of <CODE>up</CODE> and <CODE>down</CODE>,
respectively; they differ in that they do their work silently, without
causing display of the new frame.  They are intended primarily for use
in GDB command scripts, where the output might be unnecessary and
distracting.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>frame</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>f</CODE>
<DD>
When used without any argument, this command does not change which
frame is selected, but prints a brief description of the currently
selected stack frame.  It can be abbreviated <CODE>f</CODE>.  With an
argument, this command is used to select a stack frame.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC43">Selecting a frame</A>.

<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
<DT><CODE>info frame</CODE>

<UL>
<LI>

the address of the frame 
<LI>

the address of the next frame down (called by this frame)
<LI>

the address of the next frame up (caller of this frame)
<LI>

the language in which the source code corresponding to this frame is written
<LI>

the address of the frame's arguments
<LI>

the program counter saved in it (the address of execution in the caller frame)
<LI>

which registers were saved in the frame

<DT><CODE>info f <VAR>addr</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print a verbose description of the frame at address <VAR>addr</VAR>, without
selecting that frame.  The selected frame remains unchanged by this

<P>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>
MIPS based computers use an unusual stack frame, which sometimes
requires GDB to search backward in the object code to find the
beginning of a function.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
To improve response time (especially for embedded applications, where
GDB may be restricted to a slow serial line for this search)
you may want to limit the size of this search, using one of these
commands:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set heuristic-fence-post <VAR>limit</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
 
Restrict GDB to examining at most <VAR>limit</VAR> bytes in its search
for the beginning of a function.  A value of <VAR>0</VAR> (the default)
means there is no limit.  However, except for <VAR>0</VAR>, the larger the
limit the more bytes <CODE>heuristic-fence-post</CODE> must search and 
therefore the longer it takes to run.

<DT><CODE>show heuristic-fence-post</CODE>
<DD>
Display the current limit.
</DL>

<P>
These commands are available <EM>only</EM> when GDB is configured
for debugging programs on MIPS processors.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC46" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC46">Examining Source Files</A></H1>

<P>
GDB can print parts of your program's source, since the debugging
information recorded in the program tells GDB what source files were
used to build it.  When your program stops, GDB spontaneously prints
the line where it stopped.  Likewise, when you select a stack frame
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC43">Selecting a frame</A>), GDB prints the line where
execution in that frame has stopped.  You can print other portions of
source files by explicit command.

</P>
<P>
If you use GDB through its GNU Emacs interface, you may prefer 
to use
Emacs facilities to view source; see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC150">Using GDB under GNU Emacs</A>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC47" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC47">Printing source lines</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
To print lines from a source file, use the <CODE>list</CODE> command
(abbreviated <CODE>l</CODE>).  By default, ten lines are printed.  
There are several ways to specify what part of the file you want to print.

</P>
<P>
Here are the forms of the <CODE>list</CODE> command most commonly used:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>list <VAR>linenum</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print lines centered around line number <VAR>linenum</VAR> in the
current source file.

<DT><CODE>list <VAR>function</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print lines centered around the beginning of function
<VAR>function</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>list</CODE>
<DD>
Print more lines.  If the last lines printed were printed with a
<CODE>list</CODE> command, this prints lines following the last lines
printed; however, if the last line printed was a solitary line printed
as part of displaying a stack frame (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC40">Examining the Stack</A>), this prints lines centered around that line.

<DT><CODE>list -</CODE>
<DD>
Print lines just before the lines last printed.
</DL>

<P>
By default, GDB prints ten source lines with any of these forms of
the <CODE>list</CODE> command.  You can change this using <CODE>set listsize</CODE>:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set listsize <VAR>count</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
 
Make the <CODE>list</CODE> command display <VAR>count</VAR> source lines (unless
the <CODE>list</CODE> argument explicitly specifies some other number).

<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
<DT><CODE>show listsize</CODE>
<DD>
Display the number of lines that <CODE>list</CODE> prints.
</DL>

<P>
Repeating a <CODE>list</CODE> command with <KBD>RET</KBD> discards the argument,
so it is equivalent to typing just <CODE>list</CODE>.  This is more useful
than listing the same lines again.  An exception is made for an
argument of <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>; that argument is preserved in repetition so that
each repetition moves up in the source file.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>
In general, the <CODE>list</CODE> command expects you to supply zero, one or two
<STRONG>linespecs</STRONG>.  Linespecs specify source lines; there are several ways
of writing them but the effect is always to specify some source line.
Here is a complete description of the possible arguments for <CODE>list</CODE>:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>list <VAR>linespec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print lines centered around the line specified by <VAR>linespec</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>list <VAR>first</VAR>,<VAR>last</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print lines from <VAR>first</VAR> to <VAR>last</VAR>.  Both arguments are
linespecs.

<DT><CODE>list ,<VAR>last</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print lines ending with <VAR>last</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>list <VAR>first</VAR>,</CODE>
<DD>
Print lines starting with <VAR>first</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>list +</CODE>

Print lines just after the lines last printed.

<DT><CODE>list -</CODE>
<DD>
Print lines just before the lines last printed.

<DT><CODE>list</CODE>
<DD>
As described in the preceding table.
</DL>

<P>
Here are the ways of specifying a single source line--all the
kinds of linespec.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>number</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specifies line <VAR>number</VAR> of the current source file.
When a <CODE>list</CODE> command has two linespecs, this refers to
the same source file as the first linespec.

<DT><CODE>+<VAR>offset</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specifies the line <VAR>offset</VAR> lines after the last line printed.
When used as the second linespec in a <CODE>list</CODE> command that has
two, this specifies the line <VAR>offset</VAR> lines down from the
first linespec.

<DT><CODE>-<VAR>offset</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specifies the line <VAR>offset</VAR> lines before the last line printed.

<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR>:<VAR>number</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specifies line <VAR>number</VAR> in the source file <VAR>filename</VAR>.

<DT><CODE><VAR>function</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specifies the line that begins the body of the function <VAR>function</VAR>.
For example: in C, this is the line with the open brace.

<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR>:<VAR>function</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specifies the line of the open-brace that begins the body of the
function <VAR>function</VAR> in the file <VAR>filename</VAR>.  You only need the
file name with a function name to avoid ambiguity when there are
identically named functions in different source files.

<DT><CODE>*<VAR>address</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specifies the line containing the program address <VAR>address</VAR>.
<VAR>address</VAR> may be any expression.

<H2><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC49">Specifying source directories</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
Executable programs sometimes do not record the directories of the source
files from which they were compiled, just the names.  Even when they do,
the directories could be moved between the compilation and your debugging
session.  GDB has a list of directories to search for source files;
this is called the <STRONG>source path</STRONG>.  Each time GDB wants a source file,
it tries all the directories in the list, in the order they are present
in the list, until it finds a file with the desired name.  Note that
the executable search path is <EM>not</EM> used for this purpose.  Neither is
the current working directory, unless it happens to be in the source
path.

</P>
<P>
If GDB cannot find a source file in the source path, and the
object program records a directory, GDB tries that directory
too.  If the source path is empty, and there is no record of the
compilation directory, GDB looks in the current directory as a
last resort.

</P>
<P>
Whenever you reset or rearrange the source path, GDB clears out
any information it has cached about where source files are found and where
each line is in the file.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
When you start GDB, its source path is empty.
To add other directories, use the <CODE>directory</CODE> command.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>directory <VAR>dirname</VAR> ...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>dir <VAR>dirname</VAR> ...</CODE>
<DD>
Add directory <VAR>dirname</VAR> to the front of the source path.  Several
directory names may be given to this command, separated by <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> or
whitespace.  You may specify a directory that is already in the source
path; this moves it forward, so GDB searches it sooner.

<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
<A NAME="IDX223"></A>
<A NAME="IDX224"></A>
<A NAME="IDX225"></A>
<A NAME="IDX226"></A>
<A NAME="IDX227"></A>
You can use the string <SAMP>`$cdir'</SAMP> to refer to the compilation
directory (if one is recorded), and <SAMP>`$cwd'</SAMP> to refer to the current
working directory.  <SAMP>`$cwd'</SAMP> is not the same as <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>---the former
tracks the current working directory as it changes during your GDB
session, while the latter is immediately expanded to the current
directory at the time you add an entry to the source path.

<DT><CODE>directory</CODE>
<DD>
Reset the source path to empty again.  This requires confirmation.

<DT><CODE>show directories</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX228"></A>
Print the source path: show which directories it contains.
</DL>

<P>
If your source path is cluttered with directories that are no longer of
interest, GDB may sometimes cause confusion by finding the wrong
versions of source.  You can correct the situation as follows:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Use <CODE>directory</CODE> with no argument to reset the source path to empty.

<LI>

Use <CODE>directory</CODE> with suitable arguments to reinstall the
directories you want in the source path.  You can add all the
directories in one command.
</OL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC50">Source and machine code</A></H2>

<P>
You can use the command <CODE>info line</CODE> to map source lines to program
addresses (and vice versa), and the command <CODE>disassemble</CODE> to display
a range of addresses as machine instructions.  When run under GNU Emacs
mode, the <CODE>info line</CODE> command now causes the arrow to point to the

the ways understood by the <CODE>list</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC47">Printing source lines</A>).
</DL>

<P>
For example, we can use <CODE>info line</CODE> to discover the location of

The usual way to examine data in your program is with the <CODE>print</CODE>
command (abbreviated <CODE>p</CODE>), or its synonym <CODE>inspect</CODE>.  
It evaluates and prints the value of an expression of the language your

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>print <VAR>exp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>print /<VAR>f</VAR> <VAR>exp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<VAR>exp</VAR> is an expression (in the source language).  By default the
value of <VAR>exp</VAR> is printed in a format appropriate to its data type;
you can choose a different format by specifying <SAMP>`/<VAR>f</VAR>'</SAMP>, where
<VAR>f</VAR> is a letter specifying the format; see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC55">Output formats</A>.

<DT><CODE>print</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>print /<VAR>f</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
If you omit <VAR>exp</VAR>, GDB displays the last value again (from the
<STRONG>value history</STRONG>; see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC59">Value history</A>).  This allows you to
conveniently inspect the same value in an alternative format.
</DL>

<P>
A more low-level way of examining data is with the <CODE>x</CODE> command.
It examines data in memory at a specified address and prints it in a
specified format.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC56">Examining memory</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are interested in information about types, or about how the fields
of a struct
or class
are declared, use the <CODE>ptype <VAR>exp</VAR></CODE>
command rather than <CODE>print</CODE>. See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC90">Examining the Symbol Table</A>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC52" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC52">Expressions</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX245"></A>
<CODE>print</CODE> and many other GDB commands accept an expression and
compute its value.  Any kind of constant, variable or operator defined
by the programming language you are using is valid in an expression in
GDB.  This includes conditional expressions, function calls, casts
and string constants.  It unfortunately does not include symbols defined
by preprocessor <CODE>#define</CODE> commands.

</P>
<P>
GDB now supports array constants in expressions input by
the user.  The syntax is <VAR>{element, element...}</VAR>.  For example,
you can now use the command <CODE>print {1, 2, 3}</CODE> to build up an array in 
memory that is malloc'd in the target program.

</P>
<P>
Because C is so widespread, most of the expressions shown in examples in
this manual are in C.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC63">Using GDB with Different Languages</A>, for information on how to use expressions in other
languages.

</P>
<P>
In this section, we discuss operators that you can use in GDB
expressions regardless of your programming language.

</P>
<P>
Casts are supported in all languages, not just in C, because it is so
useful to cast a number into a pointer in order to examine a structure
at that address in memory.

to programming languages:

<H2><A NAME="SEC53" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC53">Program variables</A></H2>

<P>
The most common kind of expression to use is the name of a variable
in your program.

</P>
<P>
Variables in expressions are understood in the selected stack frame
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC43">Selecting a frame</A>); they must be either:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

global (or static)
</UL>

<P>
or 

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

visible according to the scope rules of the
programming language from the point of execution in that frame
</UL>

<P>
This means that in the function

</P>

<PRE>
foo (a)
     int a;
{
  bar (a);
  {
    int b = test ();
    bar (b);
  }
}
</PRE>

<P>
you can examine and use the variable <CODE>a</CODE> whenever your program is
executing within the function <CODE>foo</CODE>, but you can only use or
examine the variable <CODE>b</CODE> while your program is executing inside
the block where <CODE>b</CODE> is declared.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX250"></A>
There is an exception: you can refer to a variable or function whose
scope is a single source file even if the current execution point is not
in this file.  But it is possible to have more than one such variable or
function with the same name (in different source files).  If that
happens, referring to that name has unpredictable effects.  If you wish,
you can specify a static variable in a particular function or file,
using the colon-colon notation:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX251"></A>
<A NAME="IDX252"></A>

<PRE>
<VAR>file</VAR>::<VAR>variable</VAR>
<VAR>function</VAR>::<VAR>variable</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
Here <VAR>file</VAR> or <VAR>function</VAR> is the name of the context for the
static <VAR>variable</VAR>.  In the case of file names, you can use quotes to
make sure GDB parses the file name as a single word--for example,
to print a global value of <CODE>x</CODE> defined in <TT>`f2.c'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) p 'f2.c'::x
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX253"></A>
This use of <SAMP>`::'</SAMP> is very rarely in conflict with the very similar

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
You may see this problem when you are stepping by machine instructions.
This is because, on most machines, it takes more than one instruction to
set up a stack frame (including local variable definitions); if you are
stepping by machine instructions, variables may appear to have the wrong
values until the stack frame is completely built.  On exit, it usually
also takes more than one machine instruction to destroy a stack frame;
after you begin stepping through that group of instructions, local
variable definitions may be gone.

<H2><A NAME="SEC54" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC54">Artificial arrays</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX256"></A>
<A NAME="IDX257"></A>
It is often useful to print out several successive objects of the
same type in memory; a section of an array, or an array of
dynamically determined size for which only a pointer exists in the
program.

</P>
<P>
You can do this by referring to a contiguous span of memory as an
<STRONG>artificial array</STRONG>, using the binary operator <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>.  The left
operand of <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> should be the first element of the desired array
and be an individual object.  The right operand should be the desired length
of the array.  The result is an array value whose elements are all of
the type of the left argument.  The first element is actually the left
argument; the second element comes from bytes of memory immediately
following those that hold the first element, and so on.  Here is an
example.  If a program says

</P>

<PRE>
int *array = (int *) malloc (len * sizeof (int));
</PRE>

<P>
you can print the contents of <CODE>array</CODE> with

</P>

<PRE>
p *array@len
</PRE>

<P>
The left operand of <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> must reside in memory.  Array values made
with <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> in this way behave just like other arrays in terms of
subscripting, and are coerced to pointers when used in expressions.
Artificial arrays most often appear in expressions via the value history
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC59">Value history</A>), after printing one out.

</P>
<P>
Another way to create an artificial array is to use a cast.
This re-interprets a value as if it were an array.
The value need not be in memory:

<PRE>
(gdb) p/x (short[2])0x12345678
$1 = {0x1234, 0x5678}
</PRE>

<P>
As a convenience, if you leave the array length out (as in
<SAMP>`(<VAR>type</VAR>)[])<VAR>value</VAR>'</SAMP>) gdb calculates the size to fill
the value (as <SAMP>`sizeof(<VAR>value</VAR>)/sizeof(<VAR>type</VAR>)'</SAMP>:

<PRE>
(gdb) p/x (short[])0x12345678
$2 = {0x1234, 0x5678}
</PRE>

<P>
Sometimes the artificial array mechanism is not quite enough; in
moderately complex data structures, the elements of interest may not
actually be adjacent--for example, if you are interested in the values
of pointers in an array.  One useful work-around in this situation is
to use a convenience variable (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC60">Convenience variables</A>) as a counter in an expression that prints the first
interesting value, and then repeat that expression via <KBD>RET</KBD>.  For
instance, suppose you have an array <CODE>dtab</CODE> of pointers to
structures, and you are interested in the values of a field <CODE>fv</CODE>
in each structure.  Here is an example of what you might type:

</P>

<PRE>
set $i = 0
p dtab[$i++]-&#62;fv
<KBD>RET</KBD>
<KBD>RET</KBD>
...
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC55" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC55">Output formats</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX258"></A>
<A NAME="IDX259"></A>
By default, GDB prints a value according to its data type.  Sometimes
this is not what you want.  For example, you might want to print a number
in hex, or a pointer in decimal.  Or you might want to view data in memory
at a certain address as a character string or as an instruction.  To do
these things, specify an <STRONG>output format</STRONG> when you print a value.

</P>
<P>
The simplest use of output formats is to say how to print a value
already computed.  This is done by starting the arguments of the
<CODE>print</CODE> command with a slash and a format letter.  The format
letters supported are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>x</CODE>
<DD>
Regard the bits of the value as an integer, and print the integer in
hexadecimal.

<DT><CODE>d</CODE>
<DD>
Print as integer in signed decimal.

<DT><CODE>u</CODE>
<DD>
Print as integer in unsigned decimal.

<DT><CODE>o</CODE>
<DD>
Print as integer in octal.

<DT><CODE>t</CODE>
<DD>
Print as integer in binary.  The letter <SAMP>`t'</SAMP> stands for "two".
<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="gdb_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>

<DT><CODE>a</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX260"></A>
Print as an address, both absolute in hexadecimal and as an offset from
the nearest preceding symbol.  You can use this format used to discover
where (in what function) an unknown address is located:


<PRE>
(gdb) p/a 0x54320
$3 = 0x54320 &#60;_initialize_vx+396&#62;
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>c</CODE>
<DD>
Regard as an integer and print it as a character constant.

<DT><CODE>f</CODE>
<DD>
Regard the bits of the value as a floating point number and print
using typical floating point syntax.
</DL>

<P>
For example, to print the program counter in hex (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC61">Registers</A>), type

</P>

<PRE>
p/x $pc
</PRE>

<P>
Note that no space is required before the slash; this is because command
names in GDB cannot contain a slash.

</P>
<P>
To reprint the last value in the value history with a different format,
you can use the <CODE>print</CODE> command with just a format and no
expression.  For example, <SAMP>`p/x'</SAMP> reprints the last value in hex.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC56" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC56">Examining memory</A></H2>

<P>
You can use the command <CODE>x</CODE> (for "examine") to examine memory in
any of several formats, independently of your program's data types.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX261"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DD>
<A NAME="IDX262"></A>
 
<DT><CODE>x <VAR>addr</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>x</CODE>
<DD>
Use the <CODE>x</CODE> command to examine memory.
</DL>

<P>
<VAR>n</VAR>, <VAR>f</VAR>, and <VAR>u</VAR> are all optional parameters that specify how
much memory to display and how to format it; <VAR>addr</VAR> is an
expression giving the address where you want to start displaying memory.
If you use defaults for <VAR>nfu</VAR>, you need not type the slash <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>.
Several commands set convenient defaults for <VAR>addr</VAR>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><VAR>n</VAR>, the repeat count
<DD>
The repeat count is a decimal integer; the default is 1.  It specifies
how much memory (counting by units <VAR>u</VAR>) to display.

<DT><VAR>f</VAR>, the display format
<DD>
The display format is one of the formats used by <CODE>print</CODE>,
<SAMP>`s'</SAMP> (null-terminated string), or <SAMP>`i'</SAMP> (machine instruction).
The default is <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> (hexadecimal) initially.
The default changes each time you use either <CODE>x</CODE> or <CODE>print</CODE>.

<DT><VAR>u</VAR>, the unit size
<DD>
The unit size is any of

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>b</CODE>
<DD>
Bytes.
<DT><CODE>h</CODE>
<DD>
Halfwords (two bytes).
<DT><CODE>w</CODE>
<DD>
Words (four bytes).  This is the initial default.
<DT><CODE>g</CODE>
<DD>
Giant words (eight bytes).
</DL>

Each time you specify a unit size with <CODE>x</CODE>, that size becomes the
default unit the next time you use <CODE>x</CODE>.  (For the <SAMP>`s'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`i'</SAMP> formats, the unit size is ignored and is normally not written.)

<DT><VAR>addr</VAR>, starting display address
<DD>
<VAR>addr</VAR> is the address where you want GDB to begin displaying
memory.  The expression need not have a pointer value (though it may);
it is always interpreted as an integer address of a byte of memory.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>, for more information on expressions.  The default for
<VAR>addr</VAR> is usually just after the last address examined--but several
other commands also set the default address: <CODE>info breakpoints</CODE> (to
the address of the last breakpoint listed), <CODE>info line</CODE> (to the
starting address of a line), and <CODE>print</CODE> (if you use it to display
a value from memory).
</DL>

<P>
For example, <SAMP>`x/3uh 0x54320'</SAMP> is a request to display three halfwords
(<CODE>h</CODE>) of memory, formatted as unsigned decimal integers (<SAMP>`u'</SAMP>),
starting at address <CODE>0x54320</CODE>.  <SAMP>`x/4xw $sp'</SAMP> prints the four
words (<SAMP>`w'</SAMP>) of memory above the stack pointer (here, <SAMP>`$sp'</SAMP>;
see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC61">Registers</A>) in hexadecimal (<SAMP>`x'</SAMP>).

</P>
<P>
Since the letters indicating unit sizes are all distinct from the
letters specifying output formats, you do not have to remember whether
unit size or format comes first; either order works.  The output
specifications <SAMP>`4xw'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`4wx'</SAMP> mean exactly the same thing.
(However, the count <VAR>n</VAR> must come first; <SAMP>`wx4'</SAMP> does not work.)

</P>
<P>
Even though the unit size <VAR>u</VAR> is ignored for the formats <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>, you might still want to use a count <VAR>n</VAR>; for example,
<SAMP>`3i'</SAMP> specifies that you want to see three machine instructions,
including any operands.  The command <CODE>disassemble</CODE> gives an
alternative way of inspecting machine instructions; see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC50">Source and machine code</A>.

</P>
<P>
All the defaults for the arguments to <CODE>x</CODE> are designed to make it
easy to continue scanning memory with minimal specifications each time
you use <CODE>x</CODE>.  For example, after you have inspected three machine
instructions with <SAMP>`x/3i <VAR>addr</VAR>'</SAMP>, you can inspect the next seven
with just <SAMP>`x/7'</SAMP>.  If you use <KBD>RET</KBD> to repeat the <CODE>x</CODE> command,
the repeat count <VAR>n</VAR> is used again; the other arguments default as
for successive uses of <CODE>x</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX263"></A>
The addresses and contents printed by the <CODE>x</CODE> command are not saved
in the value history because there is often too much of them and they
would get in the way.  Instead, GDB makes these values available for
subsequent use in expressions as values of the convenience variables
<CODE>$_</CODE> and <CODE>$__</CODE>.  After an <CODE>x</CODE> command, the last address
examined is available for use in expressions in the convenience variable
<CODE>$_</CODE>.  The contents of that address, as examined, are available in
the convenience variable <CODE>$__</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>x</CODE> command has a repeat count, the address and contents saved
are from the last memory unit printed; this is not the same as the last
address printed if several units were printed on the last line of output.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC57" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC57">Automatic display</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX264"></A>
<A NAME="IDX265"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you find that you want to print the value of an expression frequently
(to see how it changes), you might want to add it to the <STRONG>automatic
display list</STRONG> so that GDB prints its value each time your program stops.
Each expression added to the list is given a number to identify it;
to remove an expression from the list, you specify that number.
The automatic display looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
2: foo = 38
3: bar[5] = (struct hack *) 0x3804
</PRE>

<P>
This display shows item numbers, expressions and their current values.  As with
displays you request manually using <CODE>x</CODE> or <CODE>print</CODE>, you can
specify the output format you prefer; in fact, <CODE>display</CODE> decides
whether to use <CODE>print</CODE> or <CODE>x</CODE> depending on how elaborate your
format specification is--it uses <CODE>x</CODE> if you specify a unit size,
or one of the two formats (<SAMP>`i'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>) that are only
supported by <CODE>x</CODE>; otherwise it uses <CODE>print</CODE>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>display <VAR>exp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX266"></A>
 
Add the expression <VAR>exp</VAR> to the list of expressions to display

<CODE>display</CODE> does not repeat if you press <KBD>RET</KBD> again after using it.

<DT><CODE>display/<VAR>fmt</VAR> <VAR>exp</VAR></CODE>

For <VAR>fmt</VAR> <SAMP>`i'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>, or including a unit-size or a

<P>
For example, <SAMP>`display/i $pc'</SAMP> can be helpful, to see the machine

<A NAME="IDX269"></A>
<DT><CODE>disable display <VAR>dnums</VAR>...</CODE>

enabled again later.

<A NAME="IDX270"></A>
<DT><CODE>enable display <VAR>dnums</VAR>...</CODE>
<DD>
Enable display of item numbers <VAR>dnums</VAR>.  It becomes effective once
again in auto display of its expression, until you specify otherwise.

<DT><CODE>display</CODE>
<DD>
Display the current values of the expressions on the list, just as is

<A NAME="IDX271"></A>
<DT><CODE>info display</CODE>
<DD>
Print the list of expressions previously set up to display

It also includes expressions which would not be displayed right now
because they refer to automatic variables not currently available.
</DL>

<P>
If a display expression refers to local variables, then it does not make
sense outside the lexical context for which it was set up.  Such an
expression is disabled when execution enters a context where one of its
variables is not defined.  For example, if you give the command
<CODE>display last_char</CODE> while inside a function with an argument
<CODE>last_char</CODE>, GDB displays this argument while your program
continues to stop inside that function.  When it stops elsewhere--where
there is no variable <CODE>last_char</CODE>---the display is disabled
automatically.  The next time your program stops where <CODE>last_char</CODE>
is meaningful, you can enable the display expression once again.

These settings are useful for debugging programs in any language:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set print address</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX274"></A>
 
<DT><CODE>set print address on</CODE>
<DD>
GDB prints memory addresses showing the location of stack
traces, structure values, pointer values, breakpoints, and so forth,
even when it also displays the contents of those addresses.  The default
is <CODE>on</CODE>.  For example, this is what a stack frame display looks like with
<CODE>set print address on</CODE>:


<PRE>
(gdb) f
#0  set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "&#60;&#60;", rq=0x34c88 "&#62;&#62;")
    at input.c:530
530         if (lquote != def_lquote)
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>set print address off</CODE>
<DD>
Do not print addresses when displaying their contents.  For example,
this is the same stack frame displayed with <CODE>set print address off</CODE>:


<PRE>
(gdb) set print addr off
(gdb) f
#0  set_quotes (lq="&#60;&#60;", rq="&#62;&#62;") at input.c:530
530         if (lquote != def_lquote)
</PRE>

You can use <SAMP>`set print address off'</SAMP> to eliminate all machine
dependent displays from the GDB interface.  For example, with
<CODE>print address off</CODE>, you should get the same text for backtraces on
all machines--whether or not they involve pointer arguments.

<A NAME="IDX275"></A>
<DT><CODE>show print address</CODE>
<DD>
Show whether or not addresses are to be printed.
</DL>

<P>
When GDB prints a symbolic address, it normally prints the
closest earlier symbol plus an offset.  If that symbol does not uniquely
identify the address (for example, it is a name whose scope is a single
source file), you may need to clarify.  One way to do this is with
<CODE>info line</CODE>, for example <SAMP>`info line *0x4537'</SAMP>.  Alternately,
you can set GDB to print the source file and line number when
it prints a symbolic address:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set print symbol-filename on</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX276"></A>
 
Tell GDB to print the source file name and line number of a
symbol in the symbolic form of an address.

<DT><CODE>set print symbol-filename off</CODE>
<DD>
Do not print source file name and line number of a symbol.  This is the
default.

<A NAME="IDX277"></A>
<DT><CODE>show print symbol-filename</CODE>
<DD>
Show whether or not GDB will print the source file name and
line number of a symbol in the symbolic form of an address.
</DL>

<P>
Another situation where it is helpful to show symbol filenames and line
numbers is when disassembling code; GDB shows you the line
number and source file that corresponds to each instruction.

</P>
<P>
Also, you may wish to see the symbolic form only if the address being
printed is reasonably close to the closest earlier symbol:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set print max-symbolic-offset <VAR>max-offset</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX278"></A>
 
Tell GDB to only display the symbolic form of an address if the
offset between the closest earlier symbol and the address is less than
<VAR>max-offset</VAR>.  The default is 0, which tells GDB 
to always print the symbolic form of an address if any symbol precedes it.

<A NAME="IDX279"></A>
<DT><CODE>show print max-symbolic-offset</CODE>
<DD>
Ask how large the maximum offset is that GDB prints in a
symbolic address.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX280"></A>
<A NAME="IDX281"></A>
If you have a pointer and you are not sure where it points, try
<SAMP>`set print symbol-filename on'</SAMP>.  Then you can determine the name
and source file location of the variable where it points, using
<SAMP>`p/a <VAR>pointer</VAR>'</SAMP>.  This interprets the address in symbolic form.
For example, here GDB shows that a variable <CODE>ptt</CODE> points
at another variable <CODE>t</CODE>, defined in <TT>`hi2.c'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) set print symbol-filename on
(gdb) p/a ptt
$4 = 0xe008 &#60;t in hi2.c&#62;

Return to compressed format for arrays.

<A NAME="IDX283"></A>

<DD>
Show whether compressed or pretty format is selected for displaying
arrays.

<A NAME="IDX284"></A>
<DT><CODE>set print elements <VAR>number-of-elements</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a limit on how many elements of an array GDB will print.
If GDB is printing a large array, it stops printing after it has
printed the number of elements set by the <CODE>set print elements</CODE> command.
This limit also applies to the display of strings.
Setting  <VAR>number-of-elements</VAR> to zero means that the printing is unlimited.

<A NAME="IDX285"></A>
<DT><CODE>show print elements</CODE>
<DD>
Display the number of elements of a large array that GDB will print.
If the number is 0, then the printing is unlimited.

<A NAME="IDX286"></A>
<DT><CODE>set print null-stop</CODE>
<DD>
Cause GDB to stop printing the characters of an array when the first
NULL is encountered.  This is useful when large arrays actually
contain only short strings.

<A NAME="IDX287"></A>
<DT><CODE>set print pretty on</CODE>
<DD>
Cause GDB to print structures in an indented format with one member 
per line, like this:


<PRE>
$1 = {
  next = 0x0,
  flags = {
    sweet = 1,
    sour = 1
  },
  meat = 0x54 "Pork"

</PRE>

<DT><CODE>set print pretty off</CODE>

Cause GDB to print structures in a compact format, like this:


<PRE>
$1 = {next = 0x0, flags = {sweet = 1, sour = 1}, \
meat = 0x54 "Pork"}
</PRE>

This is the default format.

<A NAME="IDX288"></A>

<DD>
Show which format GDB is using to print structures.

<A NAME="IDX289"></A>
<DT><CODE>set print sevenbit-strings on</CODE>
<DD>
Print using only seven-bit characters; if this option is set,
GDB displays any eight-bit characters (in strings or
character values) using the notation <CODE>\</CODE><VAR>nnn</VAR>.  This setting is
best if you are working in English (ASCII) and you use the
high-order bit of characters as a marker or "meta" bit.

<DT><CODE>set print sevenbit-strings off</CODE>

Print full eight-bit characters.  This allows the use of more
international character sets, and is the default.

<A NAME="IDX290"></A>

<H2><A NAME="SEC59" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC59">Value history</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX308"></A>
Values printed by the <CODE>print</CODE> command are saved in the GDB 
<STRONG>value history</STRONG>.  This allows you to refer to them in other expressions.  
Values are kept until the symbol table is re-read or discarded 
(for example with the <CODE>file</CODE> or <CODE>symbol-file</CODE> commands).  
When the symbol table changes, the value history is discarded, 
since the values may contain pointers back to the types defined in the 
symbol table.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX309"></A>
<A NAME="IDX310"></A>
<A NAME="IDX311"></A>
The values printed are given <STRONG>history numbers</STRONG> by which you can
refer to them.  These are successive integers starting with one.
<CODE>print</CODE> shows you the history number assigned to a value by
printing <SAMP>`$<VAR>num</VAR> = '</SAMP> before the value; here <VAR>num</VAR> is the
history number.

</P>
<P>
To refer to any previous value, use <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> followed by the value's
history number.  The way <CODE>print</CODE> labels its output is designed to
remind you of this.  Just <CODE>$</CODE> refers to the most recent value in
the history, and <CODE>$$</CODE> refers to the value before that.
<CODE>$$<VAR>n</VAR></CODE> refers to the <VAR>n</VAR>th value from the end; <CODE>$$2</CODE>
is the value just prior to <CODE>$$</CODE>, <CODE>$$1</CODE> is equivalent to
<CODE>$$</CODE>, and <CODE>$$0</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>$</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For example, suppose you have just printed a pointer to a structure and
want to see the contents of the structure.  It suffices to type

</P>

<PRE>
p *$
</PRE>

<P>
If you have a chain of structures where the component <CODE>next</CODE> points
to the next one, you can print the contents of the next one with this:

</P>

<PRE>
p *$.next
</PRE>

<P>
You can print successive links in the chain by repeating this
command--which you can do by just typing <KBD>RET</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
Note that the history records values, not expressions.  If the value of
<CODE>x</CODE> is 4 and you type these commands:

</P>

<PRE>
print x
set x=5
</PRE>

<P>
then the value recorded in the value history by the <CODE>print</CODE> command
remains 4 even though the value of <CODE>x</CODE> has changed.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>show values</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX312"></A>
 
Print the last ten values in the value history, with their item numbers.
This is like <SAMP>`p $$9'</SAMP> repeated ten times, except that <CODE>show
values</CODE> does not change the history.

<DT><CODE>show values <VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print ten history values centered on history item number <VAR>n</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>show values +</CODE>
<DD>
Print ten history values just after the values last printed.  If no more
values are available, <CODE>show values +</CODE> produces no display.

<P>
Pressing <KBD>RET</KBD> to repeat <CODE>show values <VAR>n</VAR></CODE> has exactly the

<H2><A NAME="SEC60" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC60">Convenience variables</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX313"></A>
GDB provides <STRONG>convenience variables</STRONG> that you can use within
GDB to hold on to a value and refer to it later.  These variables
exist entirely within GDB; they are not part of your program, and
setting a convenience variable has no direct effect on further execution
of your program.  That is why you can use them freely.

</P>
<P>
Convenience variables are prefixed with <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>.  Any name preceded by
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP> can be used for a convenience variable, unless it is one of
the predefined machine-specific register names (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC61">Registers</A>).
(Value history references, in contrast, are <EM>numbers</EM> preceded
by <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC59">Value history</A>.)

</P>
<P>
You can save a value in a convenience variable with an assignment
expression, just as you would set a variable in your program.
For example:

</P>

<PRE>
set $foo = *object_ptr
</PRE>

<P>
would save in <CODE>$foo</CODE> the value contained in the object pointed to by
<CODE>object_ptr</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Using a convenience variable for the first time creates it, but its
value is <CODE>void</CODE> until you assign a new value.  You can alter the
value with another assignment at any time.

</P>
<P>
Convenience variables have no fixed types.  You can assign a convenience
variable any type of value, including structures and arrays, even if
that variable already has a value of a different type.  The convenience
variable, when used as an expression, has the type of its current value.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>show convenience</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX314"></A>
 
Print a list of convenience variables used so far, and their values.
Abbreviated <CODE>show con</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
One of the ways to use a convenience variable is as a counter to be
incremented or a pointer to be advanced.  For example, to print
a field from successive elements of an array of structures:

</P>

<PRE>
set $i = 0
print bar[$i++]-&#62;contents
</PRE>

<P>
Repeat that command by typing <KBD>RET</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
Some convenience variables are created automatically by GDB and given
values likely to be useful.

<DT><CODE>$_</CODE>

The variable <CODE>$_</CODE> is automatically set by the <CODE>x</CODE> command to
the last address examined (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC56">Examining memory</A>).  Other
commands which provide a default address for <CODE>x</CODE> to examine also
set <CODE>$_</CODE> to that address; these commands include <CODE>info line</CODE>
and <CODE>info breakpoint</CODE>.  The type of <CODE>$_</CODE> is <CODE>void *</CODE>
except when set by the <CODE>x</CODE> command, in which case it is a pointer
to the type of <CODE>$__</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX316"></A>
<DT><CODE>$__</CODE>
<DD>
The variable <CODE>$__</CODE> is automatically set by the <CODE>x</CODE> command
to the value found in the last address examined.  Its type is chosen
to match the format in which the data was printed.

<DT><CODE>$_exitcode</CODE>

<H2><A NAME="SEC61" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC61">Registers</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX318"></A>
You can refer to machine register contents, in expressions, as variables
with names starting with <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>.  The names of registers are different
for each machine; use <CODE>info registers</CODE> to see the names used on
your machine.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>info registers</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX319"></A>

registers (in the selected stack frame).

<A NAME="IDX320"></A>
<A NAME="IDX321"></A>
<DT><CODE>info all-registers</CODE>
<DD>
Print the names and values of all registers, including floating-point
registers.

<DT><CODE>info registers <VAR>regname</VAR> ...</CODE>
<DD>
Print the <STRONG>relativized</STRONG> value of each specified register <VAR>regname</VAR>.
As discussed in detail below, register values are normally relative to 
the selected stack frame.  <VAR>regname</VAR> may be any register name valid on 
the machine you are using, with or without the initial <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>.
</DL>

<P>
GDB has four "standard" register names that are available (in
expressions) on most machines--whenever they do not conflict with an
architecture's canonical mnemonics for registers.  The register names
<CODE>$pc</CODE> and <CODE>$sp</CODE> are used for the program counter register and
the stack pointer.  <CODE>$fp</CODE> is used for a register that contains a
pointer to the current stack frame, and <CODE>$ps</CODE> is used for a
register that contains the processor status.  For example,
you could print the program counter in hex with

</P>

<PRE>
p/x $pc
</PRE>

<P>
or print the instruction to be executed next with

</P>

<PRE>
x/i $pc
</PRE>

<P>
or add four to the stack pointer<A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="gdb_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A> with

</P>

<PRE>
set $sp += 4
</PRE>

<P>
Whenever possible, these four standard register names are available on
your machine even though the machine has different canonical mnemonics,
so long as there is no conflict.  The <CODE>info registers</CODE> command
shows the canonical names.  For example, on the SPARC, <CODE>info
registers</CODE> displays the processor status register as <CODE>$psr</CODE> but you
can also refer to it as <CODE>$ps</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
GDB always considers the contents of an ordinary register as an
integer when the register is examined in this way.  Some machines have
special registers which can hold nothing but floating point; these
registers are considered to have floating point values.  There is no way
to refer to the contents of an ordinary register as floating point value
(although you can <EM>print</EM> it as a floating point value with
<SAMP>`print/f $<VAR>regname</VAR>'</SAMP>).

</P>
<P>
Some registers have distinct "raw" and "virtual" data formats.  This
means that the data format in which the register contents are saved by
the operating system is not the same one that your program normally
sees.  For example, the registers of the 68881 floating point
coprocessor are always saved in "extended" (raw) format, but all C
programs expect to work with "double" (virtual) format.  In such
cases, GDB normally works with the virtual format only (the format 
that makes sense for your program), but the <CODE>info registers</CODE> command
prints the data in both formats.

</P>
<P>
Normally, register values are relative to the selected stack frame
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC43">Selecting a frame</A>).  This means that you get the
value that the register would contain if all stack frames farther in
were exited and their saved registers restored.  In order to see the
true contents of hardware registers, you must select the innermost
frame (with <SAMP>`frame 0'</SAMP>).

</P>
<P>
However, GDB must deduce where registers are saved, from the machine
code generated by your compiler.  If some registers are not saved, or if
GDB is unable to locate the saved registers, the selected stack
frame makes no difference.

On AMD 29000 family processors, registers are saved in a separate
"register stack".  There is no way for GDB to determine the extent
of this stack.  Normally, GDB just assumes that the stack is "large
enough".  This may result in GDB referencing memory locations that
do not exist.  If necessary, you can get around this problem by
specifying the ending address of the register stack with the <CODE>set
rstack_high_address</CODE> command.  The argument should be an address, which
you probably want to precede with <SAMP>`0x'</SAMP> to specify in
hexadecimal.

Although programming languages generally have common aspects, they are
rarely expressed in the same manner.  For instance, in ANSI C,
dereferencing a pointer <CODE>p</CODE> is accomplished by <CODE>*p</CODE>, but in
Modula-2, it is accomplished by <CODE>p^</CODE>.  Values can also be
represented (and displayed) differently.  Hex numbers in C appear as 
<SAMP>`0x1ae'</SAMP>, while in Modula-2 they appear as <SAMP>`1AEH'</SAMP>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX329"></A>
Language-specific information is built into GDB for some languages,
allowing you to express operations like the above in your program's
native language, and allowing GDB to output values in a manner
consistent with the syntax of your program's native language.  The
language you use to build expressions is called the <STRONG>working
language</STRONG>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC64" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC64">Switching between source languages</A></H2>

<P>
There are two ways to control the working language--either have GDB
set it automatically, or select it manually yourself.  You can use the
<CODE>set language</CODE> command for either purpose.  On startup, GDB
defaults to setting the language automatically.  The working language is
used to determine how expressions you type are interpreted, how values
are printed, etc.

</P>
<P>
In addition to the working language, every source file that
GDB knows about has its own working language.  For some object
file formats, the compiler might indicate which language a particular
source file is in.  However, most of the time GDB infers the
language from the name of the file.  The language of a source file
controls whether C++ names are demangled--this way <CODE>backtrace</CODE> can
show each frame appropriately for its own language.  There is no way to
set the language of a source file from within GDB.  

</P>
<P>
This is most commonly a problem when you use a program, such
as <CODE>cfront</CODE> or <CODE>f2c</CODE>, that generates C but is written in 
another language.  In that case, make the
program use <CODE>#line</CODE> directives in its C output; that way
GDB will know the correct language of the source code of the original
program, and will display that source code, not the generated C code.

<H3><A NAME="SEC66" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC66">Setting the working language</A></H3>

<P>
If you allow GDB to set the language automatically,
expressions are interpreted the same way in your debugging session and
your program.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX330"></A>
If you wish, you may set the language manually.  To do this, issue the
command <SAMP>`set language <VAR>lang</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>lang</VAR> is the name of
a language, such as 
<CODE>c</CODE> or <CODE>modula-2</CODE>.
For a list of the supported languages, type <SAMP>`set language'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Setting the language manually prevents GDB from updating the working
language automatically.  This can lead to confusion if you try
to debug a program when the working language is not the same as the
source language, when an expression is acceptable to both
languages--but means different things.  For instance, if the current
source file were written in C, and GDB was parsing Modula-2, a
command such as:

</P>

<PRE>
print a = b + c
</PRE>

<P>
might not have the effect you intended.  In C, this means to add
<CODE>b</CODE> and <CODE>c</CODE> and place the result in <CODE>a</CODE>.  The result
printed would be the value of <CODE>a</CODE>.  In Modula-2, this means to compare
<CODE>a</CODE> to the result of <CODE>b+c</CODE>, yielding a <CODE>BOOLEAN</CODE> value.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC67" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC67">Having GDB infer the source language</A></H3>

<P>
To have GDB set the working language automatically, use
<SAMP>`set language local'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`set language auto'</SAMP>.  GDB
then infers the working language.  That is, when your program stops in a
frame (usually by encountering a breakpoint), GDB sets the
working language to the language recorded for the function in that
frame.  If the language for a frame is unknown (that is, if the function
or block corresponding to the frame was defined in a source file that
does not have a recognized extension), the current working language is
not changed, and GDB issues a warning.

</P>
<P>
This may not seem necessary for most programs, which are written
entirely in one source language.  However, program modules and libraries
written in one source language can be used by a main program written in
a different source language.  Using <SAMP>`set language auto'</SAMP> in this

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> In this release, the GDB commands for type and range
checking are included, but they do not yet have any effect.  This
section documents the intended facilities.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Some languages are designed to guard you against making seemingly common
errors through a series of compile- and run-time checks.  These include
checking the type of arguments to functions and operators, and making
sure mathematical overflows are caught at run time.  Checks such as
these help to ensure a program's correctness once it has been compiled
by eliminating type mismatches, and providing active checks for range
errors when your program is running.

</P>
<P>
GDB can check for conditions like the above if you wish.
Although GDB does not check the statements in your program, it
can check expressions entered directly into GDB for evaluation via
the <CODE>print</CODE> command, for example.  As with the working language,
GDB can also decide whether or not to check automatically based on
your program's source language.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>,
for the default settings of supported languages.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX334"></A>
<A NAME="IDX335"></A>


<H3><A NAME="SEC70" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC70">An overview of type checking</A></H3>

<P>
Some languages, such as Modula-2, are strongly typed, meaning that the
arguments to operators and functions have to be of the correct type,
otherwise an error occurs.  These checks prevent type mismatch
errors from ever causing any run-time problems.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
1 + 2 => 3
but
error--> 1 + 2.3
</PRE>

<P>
The second example fails because the <CODE>CARDINAL</CODE> 1 is not
type-compatible with the <CODE>REAL</CODE> 2.3.

</P>
<P>
For the expressions you use in GDB commands, you can tell the 
GDB type checker to skip checking; 
to treat any mismatches as errors and abandon the expression; 
or to only issue warnings when type mismatches occur, 
but evaluate the expression anyway.  When you choose the last of
these, GDB evaluates expressions like the second example above, but
also issues a warning.

</P>
<P>
Even if you turn type checking off, there may be other reasons 
related to type that prevent GDB from evaluating an expression.  
For instance, GDB does not know how to add an <CODE>int</CODE> and 
a <CODE>struct foo</CODE>.  These particular type errors have nothing to do 
with the language in use, and usually arise from expressions, such as 
the one described above, which make little sense to evaluate anyway.

</P>
<P>
Each language defines to what degree it is strict about type.  For
instance, both Modula-2 and C require the arguments to arithmetical
operators to be numbers.  In C, enumerated types and pointers can be
represented as numbers, so that they are valid arguments to mathematical
operators.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>, for further
details on specific languages.

</P>
<P>
GDB provides some additional commands for controlling the type checker:

<DT><CODE>set check type off</CODE>
<DD>
Set type checking on or off, overriding the default setting for the
current working language.  Issue a warning if the setting does not
match the language default.  If any type mismatches occur in
evaluating an expression while typechecking is on, GDB prints a
message and aborts evaluation of the expression.

<DT><CODE>set check type warn</CODE>
<DD>
Cause the type checker to issue warnings, but to always attempt to
evaluate the expression.  Evaluating the expression may still
be impossible for other reasons.  For example, GDB cannot add

<H3><A NAME="SEC71" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC71">An overview of range checking</A></H3>

<P>
In some languages (such as Modula-2), it is an error to exceed the
bounds of a type; this is enforced with run-time checks.  Such range
checking is meant to ensure program correctness by making sure
computations do not overflow, or indices on an array element access do
not exceed the bounds of the array.

</P>
<P>
For expressions you use in GDB commands, you can tell
GDB to treat range errors in one of three ways: ignore them,
always treat them as errors and abandon the expression, or issue
warnings but evaluate the expression anyway.

</P>
<P>
A range error can result from numerical overflow, from exceeding an
array index bound, or when you type a constant that is not a member
of any type.  Some languages, however, do not treat overflows as an
error.  In many implementations of C, mathematical overflow causes the
result to "wrap around" to lower values--for example, if <VAR>m</VAR> is
the largest integer value, and <VAR>s</VAR> is the smallest, then

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>m</VAR> + 1 => <VAR>s</VAR>
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>set check range on</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>set check range off</CODE>
<DD>
Set range checking on or off, overriding the default setting for the
current working language.  A warning is issued if the setting does not
match the language default.  If a range error occurs, then a message
is printed and evaluation of the expression is aborted.

<DT><CODE>set check range warn</CODE>
<DD>
Output messages when the GDB range checker detects a range error,
but attempt to evaluate the expression anyway.  Evaluating the
expression may still be impossible for other reasons, such as accessing
memory that the process does not own (a typical example from many Unix
systems).

<DT><CODE>show range</CODE>
<DD>
Show the current setting of the range checker, and whether or not it is
being set automatically by GDB.

<P>
GDB 4 supports C, C++, and Modula-2.
Some GDB features may be used in expressions regardless of the
language you use: the GDB <CODE>@</CODE> and <CODE>::</CODE> operators,
and the <SAMP>`{type}addr'</SAMP> construct (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>) can be used with the constructs of any supported
language.

</P>
<P>
The following sections detail to what degree each source language is
supported by GDB.  These sections are not meant to be language
tutorials or references, but serve only as a reference guide to what the
GDB expression parser accepts, and what input and output
formats should look like for different languages.  There are many good
books written on each of these languages; please look to these for a
language reference or tutorial.

</UL>

<P>
The following operators are supported.  They are listed here
in order of increasing precedence:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>,</CODE>
<DD>
The comma or sequencing operator.  Expressions in a comma-separated list
are evaluated from left to right, with the result of the entire
expression being the last expression evaluated.

<DT><CODE>=</CODE>
<DD>
Assignment.  The value of an assignment expression is the value
assigned.  Defined on scalar types.

<DT><CODE><VAR>op</VAR>=</CODE>
<DD>
Used in an expression of the form <CODE><VAR>a</VAR> <VAR>op</VAR>= <VAR>b</VAR></CODE>,
and translated to <CODE><VAR>a</VAR> = <VAR>a op b</VAR></CODE>.
<CODE><VAR>op</VAR>=</CODE> and <CODE>=</CODE> have the same precendence.

<DD>
Multiplication, division, and modulus.  Multiplication and division are
defined on integral and floating-point types.  Modulus is defined on
integral types.

<DT><CODE>++, --</CODE>

Pointer dereferencing.  Defined on pointer types.  Same precedence as
<CODE>++</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>&#38;</CODE>
<DD>
Address operator.  Defined on variables.  Same precedence as <CODE>++</CODE>.

For debugging C++, GDB implements a use of <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> beyond what is

<H4><A NAME="SEC75" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC75">C and C++ constants</A></H4>

<P>
GDB allows you to express the constants of C and C++ in the
following ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Integer constants are a sequence of digits.  Octal constants are
specified by a leading <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> (i.e. zero), and hexadecimal constants by
a leading <SAMP>`0x'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`0X'</SAMP>.  Constants may also end with a letter
<SAMP>`l'</SAMP>, specifying that the constant should be treated as a
<CODE>long</CODE> value.

<LI>

Floating point constants are a sequence of digits, followed by a decimal
point, followed by a sequence of digits, and optionally followed by an
exponent.  An exponent is of the form:
<SAMP>`e[[+]|-]<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>nnn</VAR> is another
sequence of digits.  The <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> is optional for positive exponents.

<LI>

Enumerated constants consist of enumerated identifiers, or their
integral equivalents.

<LI>

Character constants are a single character surrounded by single quotes
(<CODE>'</CODE>), or a number--the ordinal value of the corresponding character
(usually its ASCII value).  Within quotes, the single character may
be represented by a letter or by <STRONG>escape sequences</STRONG>, which are of
the form <SAMP>`\<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>nnn</VAR> is the octal representation
of the character's ordinal value; or of the form <SAMP>`\<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP>, where
<SAMP>`<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP> is a predefined special character--for example,
<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP> for newline.

<LI>

String constants are a sequence of character constants surrounded
by double quotes (<CODE>"</CODE>).

<LI>

Pointer constants are an integral value.  You can also write pointers
to constants using the C operator <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP>.

<LI>

Array constants are comma-separated lists surrounded by braces <SAMP>`{'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`}'</SAMP>; for example, <SAMP>`{1,2,3}'</SAMP> is a three-element array of
integers, <SAMP>`{{1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}}'</SAMP> is a three-by-two array,
and <SAMP>`{&#38;"hi", &#38;"there", &#38;"fred"}'</SAMP> is a three-element array of pointers.

<EM>Warning:</EM> GDB can only debug C++ code if you compile with
the GNU C++ compiler.  Moreover, C++ debugging depends on the use of
additional debugging information in the symbol table, and thus requires
special support.  GDB has this support <EM>only</EM> with the
stabs debug format.  In particular, if your compiler generates a.out,
MIPS ECOFF, RS/6000 XCOFF, or ELF with stabs extensions
to the symbol table, these facilities are all available.  (With GNU CC,
you can use the <SAMP>`-gstabs'</SAMP> option to request stabs debugging
extensions explicitly.)  Where the object code format is standard
COFF or DWARF in ELF, on the other hand, most of the C++

<OL>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX361"></A>
 
Member function calls are allowed; you can use expressions like


<PRE>
count = aml-&#62;GetOriginal(x, y)
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX362"></A>
<A NAME="IDX363"></A>
<LI>

While a member function is active (in the selected stack frame), your
expressions have the same namespace available as the member function;
that is, GDB allows implicit references to the class instance
pointer <CODE>this</CODE> following the same rules as C++.

<A NAME="IDX364"></A>
<A NAME="IDX365"></A>
<LI>

You can call overloaded functions; GDB resolves the function
call to the right definition, with one restriction--you must use
arguments of the type required by the function that you want to call.
GDB does not perform conversions requiring constructors or
user-defined type operators.

<A NAME="IDX366"></A>
<LI>

GDB understands variables declared as C++ references; you can use 
them in expressions just as you do in C++ source--they are automatically
dereferenced.

In the parameter list shown when GDB displays a frame, the values of
reference variables are not displayed (unlike other variables); this
avoids clutter, since references are often used for large structures.
The <EM>address</EM> of a reference variable is always shown, unless
you have specified <SAMP>`set print address off'</SAMP>.

<LI>

GDB supports the C++ name resolution operator <CODE>::</CODE>---your
expressions can use it just as expressions in your program do.  Since
one scope may be defined in another, you can use <CODE>::</CODE> repeatedly if
necessary, for example in an expression like
<SAMP>`<VAR>scope1</VAR>::<VAR>scope2</VAR>::<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>.  GDB also allows
resolving name scope by reference to source files, in both C and C++
debugging (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC53">Program variables</A>).

selects the working language.

</P>
<P>
If you allow GDB to set the language automatically, it recognizes

it sets the working language to C or C++.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX368"></A>

</P>
<P>
By default, when GDB parses C or C++ expressions, type checking
is not used.  However, if you turn type checking on, GDB
considers two variables type equivalent if:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The two variables are structured and have the same structure, union, or
enumerated tag.

<LI>

The two variables have the same type name, or types that have been
declared equivalent through <CODE>typedef</CODE>.

</UL>

<P>
Range checking, if turned on, is done on mathematical operations.  Array
indices are not checked, since they are often used to index a pointer
that is not itself an array.

Increments the value in the variable <VAR>v</VAR> by <VAR>i</VAR>.  Returns the
new value.

<DT><CODE>INCL(<VAR>m</VAR>,<VAR>s</VAR>)</CODE>

Returns the minimum value of the type <VAR>t</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>ODD(<VAR>i</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns boolean TRUE if <VAR>i</VAR> is an odd number.

<DT><CODE>ORD(<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the ordinal value of its argument.  For example, the ordinal
value of a character is its ASCII value (on machines supporting the
ASCII character set).  <VAR>x</VAR> must be of an ordered type, which include
integral, character and enumerated types.

<H4><A NAME="SEC84" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC84">Constants</A></H4>

<P>
GDB allows you to express the constants of Modula-2 in the following
ways:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Integer constants are simply a sequence of digits.  When used in an
expression, a constant is interpreted to be type-compatible with the
rest of the expression.  Hexadecimal integers are specified by a
trailing <SAMP>`H'</SAMP>, and octal integers by a trailing <SAMP>`B'</SAMP>.

<LI>

Floating point constants appear as a sequence of digits, followed by a
decimal point and another sequence of digits.  An optional exponent can
then be specified, in the form <SAMP>`E[+|-]<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP>, where
<SAMP>`[+|-]<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP> is the desired exponent.  All of the
digits of the floating point constant must be valid decimal (base 10)
digits.

<LI>

Character constants consist of a single character enclosed by a pair of
like quotes, either single (<CODE>'</CODE>) or double (<CODE>"</CODE>).  They may
also be expressed by their ordinal value (their ASCII value, usually)
followed by a <SAMP>`C'</SAMP>.

<LI>

String constants consist of a sequence of characters enclosed by a
pair of like quotes, either single (<CODE>'</CODE>) or double (<CODE>"</CODE>).
Escape sequences in the style of C are also allowed.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC75">C and C++ constants</A>, for a brief explanation of escape
sequences.

<LI>

Enumerated constants consist of an enumerated identifier.

<LI>

Boolean constants consist of the identifiers <CODE>TRUE</CODE> and
<CODE>FALSE</CODE>.

<LI>

Pointer constants consist of integral values only.

<LI>

Set constants are not yet supported.
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX380"></A>

</P>
<P>
If type and range checking are set automatically by GDB, they
both default to <CODE>on</CODE> whenever the working language changes to
Modula-2.  This happens regardless of whether you, or GDB,
selected the working language.

</P>
<P>
If you allow GDB to set the language automatically, then entering
code compiled from a file whose name ends with <TT>`.mod'</TT> sets the
working language to Modula-2. See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC67">Having GDB infer the source language</A>, for further details.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC86" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC86">Deviations from standard Modula-2</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX381"></A>

</P>
<P>
A few changes have been made to make Modula-2 programs easier to debug.
This is done primarily via loosening its type strictness:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Unlike in standard Modula-2, pointer constants can be formed by
integers.  This allows you to modify pointer variables during
debugging.  (In standard Modula-2, the actual address contained in a
pointer variable is hidden from you; it can only be modified
through direct assignment to another pointer variable or expression that
returned a pointer.)

<LI>

C escape sequences can be used in strings and characters to represent
non-printable characters.  GDB prints out strings with these
escape sequences embedded.  Single non-printable characters are
printed using the <SAMP>`CHR(<VAR>nnn</VAR>)'</SAMP> format.

<LI>

The assignment operator (<CODE>:=</CODE>) returns the value of its right-hand
argument.

<LI>

All built-in procedures both modify <EM>and</EM> return their argument.
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
As long as type checking is enabled, any attempt to combine variables
whose types are not equivalent is an error.

<A NAME="IDX385"></A>
<A NAME="IDX386"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are a few subtle differences between the Modula-2 scope operator
(<CODE>.</CODE>) and the GDB scope operator (<CODE>::</CODE>).  The two have
similar syntax:

</P>

<PRE>

<VAR>module</VAR> . <VAR>id</VAR>
<VAR>scope</VAR> :: <VAR>id</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>scope</VAR> is the name of a module or a procedure,
<VAR>module</VAR> the name of a module, and <VAR>id</VAR> is any declared
identifier within your program, except another module.

</P>
<P>
Using the <CODE>::</CODE> operator makes GDB search the scope
specified by <VAR>scope</VAR> for the identifier <VAR>id</VAR>.  If it is not
found in the specified scope, then GDB searches all scopes
enclosing the one specified by <VAR>scope</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
Using the <CODE>.</CODE> operator makes GDB search the current scope for
the identifier specified by <VAR>id</VAR> that was imported from the
definition module specified by <VAR>module</VAR>.  With this operator, it is
an error if the identifier <VAR>id</VAR> was not imported from definition
module <VAR>module</VAR>, or if <VAR>id</VAR> is not an identifier in
<VAR>module</VAR>.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC89" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC89">GDB and Modula-2</A></H4>

<P>
Some GDB commands have little use when debugging Modula-2 programs.
Five subcommands of <CODE>set print</CODE> and <CODE>show print</CODE> apply
specifically to C and C++: <SAMP>`vtbl'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`demangle'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`asm-demangle'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`object'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`union'</SAMP>.  The first four
apply to C++, and the last to the C <CODE>union</CODE> type, which has no direct
analogue in Modula-2.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>@</CODE> operator (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>), while available
while using any language, is not useful with Modula-2.  Its
intent is to aid the debugging of <STRONG>dynamic arrays</STRONG>, which cannot be
created in Modula-2 as they can in C or C++.  However, because an
address can be specified by an integral constant, the construct
<SAMP>`{<VAR>type</VAR>}<VAR>adrexp</VAR>'</SAMP> is still useful.  (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX387"></A>
In GDB scripts, the Modula-2 inequality operator <CODE>#</CODE> is

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC90" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC90">Examining the Symbol Table</A></H1>

<P>
The commands described in this section allow you to inquire about the
symbols (names of variables, functions and types) defined in your
program.  This information is inherent in the text of your program and
does not change as your program executes.  GDB finds it in your
program's symbol table, in the file indicated when you started GDB
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC7">Choosing files</A>), or by one of the
file-management commands (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC99">Commands to specify files</A>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX388"></A>
<A NAME="IDX389"></A>
<A NAME="IDX390"></A>
Occasionally, you may need to refer to symbols that contain unusual
characters, which GDB ordinarily treats as word delimiters.  The
most frequent case is in referring to static variables in other
source files (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC53">Program variables</A>).  File names
are recorded in object files as debugging symbols, but GDB would
ordinarily parse a typical file name, like <TT>`foo.c'</TT>, as the three words
<SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> <SAMP>`c'</SAMP>.  To allow GDB to recognize
<SAMP>`foo.c'</SAMP> as a single symbol, enclose it in single quotes; for example,

</P>

<PRE>
p 'foo.c'::x
</PRE>

<P>
looks up the value of <CODE>x</CODE> in the scope of the file <TT>`foo.c'</TT>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>info address <VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX391"></A>
 
Describe where the data for <VAR>symbol</VAR> is stored.  For a register
variable, this says which register it is kept in.  For a non-register
local variable, this prints the stack-frame offset at which the variable
is always stored.

Note the contrast with <SAMP>`print &#38;<VAR>symbol</VAR>'</SAMP>, which does not work
at all for a register variable, and for a stack local variable prints
the exact address of the current instantiation of the variable.

<A NAME="IDX392"></A>
<DT><CODE>whatis <VAR>exp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print the data type of expression <VAR>exp</VAR>.  <VAR>exp</VAR> is not
actually evaluated, and any side-effecting operations (such as
assignments or function calls) inside it do not take place.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>.

<DT><CODE>whatis</CODE>
<DD>
Print the data type of <CODE>$</CODE>, the last value in the value history.

<A NAME="IDX393"></A>
<DT><CODE>ptype <VAR>typename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print a description of data type <VAR>typename</VAR>.  <VAR>typename</VAR> may be
the name of a type, or for C code it may have the form
<SAMP>`class <VAR>class-name</VAR>'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`struct <VAR>struct-tag</VAR>'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`union <VAR>union-tag</VAR>'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`enum <VAR>enum-tag</VAR>'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>ptype <VAR>exp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ptype</CODE>
<DD>
Print a description of the type of expression <VAR>exp</VAR>.  <CODE>ptype</CODE>
differs from <CODE>whatis</CODE> by printing a detailed description, instead
of just the name of the type.

For example, for this variable declaration:


<PRE>
struct complex {double real; double imag;} v;
</PRE>

the two commands give this output:


<PRE>
(gdb) whatis v
type = struct complex
(gdb) ptype v
type = struct complex {
    double real;
    double imag;
}
</PRE>

As with <CODE>whatis</CODE>, using <CODE>ptype</CODE> without an argument refers to
the type of <CODE>$</CODE>, the last value in the value history.

<A NAME="IDX394"></A>
<DT><CODE>info types <VAR>regexp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>info types</CODE>
<DD>
Print a brief description of all types whose name matches <VAR>regexp</VAR>
(or all types in your program, if you supply no argument).  Each
complete typename is matched as though it were a complete line; thus,
<SAMP>`i type value'</SAMP> gives information on all types in your program whose
name includes the string <CODE>value</CODE>, but <SAMP>`i type ^value$'</SAMP> gives
information only on types whose complete name is <CODE>value</CODE>.

This command differs from <CODE>ptype</CODE> in two ways: first, like
<CODE>whatis</CODE>, it does not print a detailed description; second, it
lists all source files where a type is defined.

<A NAME="IDX395"></A>
<DT><CODE>info source</CODE>
<DD>
Show the name of the current source file--that is, the source file for
the function containing the current point of execution--and the language
it was written in.

<A NAME="IDX396"></A>
<DT><CODE>info sources</CODE>
<DD>
Print the names of all source files in your program for which there is
debugging information, organized into two lists: files whose symbols
have already been read, and files whose symbols will be read when needed.

<A NAME="IDX397"></A>
<DT><CODE>info functions</CODE>
<DD>
Print the names and data types of all defined functions.

<DT><CODE>info functions <VAR>regexp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print the names and data types of all defined functions
whose names contain a match for regular expression <VAR>regexp</VAR>.
Thus, <SAMP>`info fun step'</SAMP> finds all functions whose names
include <CODE>step</CODE>; <SAMP>`info fun ^step'</SAMP> finds those whose names
start with <CODE>step</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX398"></A>
<DT><CODE>info variables</CODE>
<DD>
Print the names and data types of all variables that are declared
outside of functions (i.e., excluding local variables).

<DT><CODE>info variables <VAR>regexp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print the names and data types of all variables (except for local
variables) whose names contain a match for regular expression
<VAR>regexp</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX399"></A>
Some systems allow individual object files that make up your program to
be replaced without stopping and restarting your program.
For example, in VxWorks you can simply recompile a defective object file
and keep on running.
If you are running on one of these systems, you can allow GDB to
reload the symbols for automatically relinked modules:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set symbol-reloading on</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX400"></A>
 
Replace symbol definitions for the corresponding source file when an
object file with a particular name is seen again.

<DT><CODE>set symbol-reloading off</CODE>
<DD>
Do not replace symbol definitions when re-encountering object files of
the same name.  This is the default state; if you are not running on a
system that permits automatically relinking modules, you should leave
<CODE>symbol-reloading</CODE> off, since otherwise GDB may discard symbols
when linking large programs, that may contain several modules (from
different directories or libraries) with the same name.

<A NAME="IDX401"></A>
<DT><CODE>show symbol-reloading</CODE>
<DD>
Show the current <CODE>on</CODE> or <CODE>off</CODE> setting.
</DL>

<A NAME="IDX402"></A>
<A NAME="IDX403"></A>
<A NAME="IDX404"></A>
<A NAME="IDX405"></A>
<DT><CODE>maint print symbols <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>maint print psymbols <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>maint print msymbols <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Write a dump of debugging symbol data into the file <VAR>filename</VAR>.
These commands are used to debug the GDB symbol-reading code.  Only
symbols with debugging data are included.  If you use <SAMP>`maint print
symbols'</SAMP>, GDB includes all the symbols for which it has already
collected full details: that is, <VAR>filename</VAR> reflects symbols for
only those files whose symbols GDB has read.  You can use the
command <CODE>info sources</CODE> to find out which files these are.  If you
use <SAMP>`maint print psymbols'</SAMP> instead, the dump shows information about
symbols that GDB only knows partially--that is, symbols defined in
files that GDB has skimmed, but not yet read completely.  Finally,
<SAMP>`maint print msymbols'</SAMP> dumps just the minimal symbol information
required for each object file from which GDB has read some symbols.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC99">Commands to specify files</A>, for a discussion of how
GDB reads symbols (in the description of <CODE>symbol-file</CODE>).
</DL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC91" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC91">Altering Execution</A></H1>

<P>
Once you think you have found an error in your program, you might want to
find out for certain whether correcting the apparent error would lead to
correct results in the rest of the run.  You can find the answer by
experiment, using the GDB features for altering execution of the
program.

</P>
<P>
For example, you can store new values into variables or memory
locations,
give your program a signal, restart it
at a different address, or even return prematurely from a function.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC92" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC92">Assignment to variables</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX406"></A>
<A NAME="IDX407"></A>
To alter the value of a variable, evaluate an assignment expression.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
print x=4
</PRE>

<P>
stores the value 4 into the variable <CODE>x</CODE>, and then prints the
value of the assignment expression (which is 4).  
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC63">Using GDB with Different Languages</A>, for more
information on operators in supported languages.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX408"></A>
<A NAME="IDX409"></A>
If you are not interested in seeing the value of the assignment, use the
<CODE>set</CODE> command instead of the <CODE>print</CODE> command.  <CODE>set</CODE> is
really the same as <CODE>print</CODE> except that the expression's value is
not printed and is not put in the value history (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC59">Value history</A>).  The expression is evaluated only for its effects.

</P>
<P>
If the beginning of the argument string of the <CODE>set</CODE> command
appears identical to a <CODE>set</CODE> subcommand, use the <CODE>set
variable</CODE> command instead of just <CODE>set</CODE>.  This command is identical
to <CODE>set</CODE> except for its lack of subcommands.  For example, if
your program has a variable <CODE>width</CODE>, you get
an error if you try to set a new value with just <SAMP>`set width=13'</SAMP>,
because GDB has the command <CODE>set width</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) whatis width
type = double
(gdb) p width
$4 = 13
(gdb) set width=47
Invalid syntax in expression.
</PRE>

<P>
The invalid expression, of course, is <SAMP>`=47'</SAMP>.  In
order to actually set the program's variable <CODE>width</CODE>, use

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) set var width=47
</PRE>

<P>
GDB allows more implicit conversions in assignments than C; you can
freely store an integer value into a pointer variable or vice versa,
and you can convert any structure to any other structure that is the
same length or shorter.

</P>
<P>
To store values into arbitrary places in memory, use the <SAMP>`{...}'</SAMP>
construct to generate a value of specified type at a specified address
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>).  For example, <CODE>{int}0x83040</CODE> refers
to memory location <CODE>0x83040</CODE> as an integer (which implies a certain size
and representation in memory), and

</P>

<PRE>
set {int}0x83040 = 4
</PRE>

<P>
stores the value 4 into that memory location.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC93" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC93">Continuing at a different address</A></H2>

<P>
Ordinarily, when you continue your program, you do so at the place where
it stopped, with the <CODE>continue</CODE> command.  You can instead continue at
an address of your own choosing, with the following commands:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>jump <VAR>linespec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX410"></A>
 
Resume execution at line <VAR>linespec</VAR>.  Execution stops again
immediately if there is a breakpoint there.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC47">Printing source lines</A>, for a description of the different forms of
<VAR>linespec</VAR>.

The <CODE>jump</CODE> command does not change the current stack frame, or
the stack pointer, or the contents of any memory location or any
register other than the program counter.  If line <VAR>linespec</VAR> is in
a different function from the one currently executing, the results may
be bizarre if the two functions expect different patterns of arguments or
of local variables.  For this reason, the <CODE>jump</CODE> command requests
confirmation if the specified line is not in the function currently
executing.  However, even bizarre results are predictable if you are
well acquainted with the machine-language code of your program.

<DT><CODE>jump *<VAR>address</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Resume execution at the instruction at address <VAR>address</VAR>.
</DL>

<P>
You can get much the same effect as the <CODE>jump</CODE> command by storing a
new value into the register <CODE>$pc</CODE>.  The difference is that this
does not start your program running; it only changes the address of where it
<EM>will</EM> run when you continue.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
set $pc = 0x485
</PRE>

<P>
makes the next <CODE>continue</CODE> command or stepping command execute at
address <CODE>0x485</CODE>, rather than at the address where your program stopped.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC37">Continuing and stepping</A>.

</P>
<P>
The most common occasion to use the <CODE>jump</CODE> command is to back up--
perhaps with more breakpoints set--over a portion of a program that has
already executed, in order to examine its execution in more detail.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC94" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC94">Giving your program a signal</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>signal <VAR>signal</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX411"></A>
 
Resume execution where your program stopped, but immediately give it the
signal <VAR>signal</VAR>.  <VAR>signal</VAR> can be the name or the number of a
signal.  For example, on many systems <CODE>signal 2</CODE> and <CODE>signal
SIGINT</CODE> are both ways of sending an interrupt signal.

Alternatively, if <VAR>signal</VAR> is zero, continue execution without
giving a signal.  This is useful when your program stopped on account of
a signal and would ordinary see the signal when resumed with the
<CODE>continue</CODE> command; <SAMP>`signal 0'</SAMP> causes it to resume without a
signal.

<CODE>signal</CODE> does not repeat when you press <KBD>RET</KBD> a second time
after executing the command.
</DL>

<P>
Invoking the <CODE>signal</CODE> command is not the same as invoking the
<CODE>kill</CODE> utility from the shell.  Sending a signal with <CODE>kill</CODE>
causes GDB to decide what to do with the signal depending on
the signal handling tables (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC38">Signals</A>).  The <CODE>signal</CODE> command
passes the signal directly to your program.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC95" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC95">Returning from a function</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>return</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX412"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX413"></A>
 
<DT><CODE>return <VAR>expression</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
You can cancel execution of a function call with the <CODE>return</CODE>
command.  If you give an
<VAR>expression</VAR> argument, its value is used as the function's return
value.
</DL>

<P>
When you use <CODE>return</CODE>, GDB discards the selected stack frame
(and all frames within it).  You can think of this as making the
discarded frame return prematurely.  If you wish to specify a value to
be returned, give that value as the argument to <CODE>return</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
This pops the selected stack frame (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC43">Selecting a frame</A>), and any other frames inside of it, leaving its caller as the
innermost remaining frame.  That frame becomes selected.  The
specified value is stored in the registers used for returning values
of functions.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>return</CODE> command does not resume execution; it leaves the

By default, GDB opens the file containing your program's executable

read-only.  This prevents accidental alterations
to machine code; but it also prevents you from intentionally patching
your program's binary.

</P>
<P>
If you'd like to be able to patch the binary, you can specify that
explicitly with the <CODE>set write</CODE> command.  For example, you might

GDB needs to know the file name of the program to be debugged, both in

You may want to specify executable and core dump file names.
The usual way to do this is at start-up time, using the arguments to 
GDB's start-up commands (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC5">Getting In and Out of GDB</A>).

</P>
<P>
Occasionally it is necessary to change to a different file during a
GDB session.  Or you may run GDB and forget to specify
a file you want to use.  In these situations the GDB commands
to specify new files are useful.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>file <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX423"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX424"></A>
 
Use <VAR>filename</VAR> as the program to be debugged.  It is read for its
symbols and for the contents of pure memory.  It is also the program
executed when you use the <CODE>run</CODE> command.  If you do not specify a
directory and the file is not found in the GDB working directory, 
GDB uses the environment variable <CODE>PATH</CODE> as a list of 
directories to search, just as the shell does when looking for a program 
to run.  You can change the value of this variable, for both GDB 
and your program, using the <CODE>path</CODE> command.

On systems with memory-mapped files, an auxiliary file
<TT>`<VAR>filename</VAR>.syms'</TT> may hold symbol table information for
<VAR>filename</VAR>.  If so, GDB maps in the symbol table from
<TT>`<VAR>filename</VAR>.syms'</TT>, starting up more quickly.  See the
descriptions of the file options <SAMP>`-mapped'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-readnow'</SAMP>
(available on the command line, and with the commands <CODE>file</CODE>,
<CODE>symbol-file</CODE>, or <CODE>add-symbol-file</CODE>, described below), 
for more information.

<DT><CODE>file</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>file</CODE> with no argument makes GDB discard any information it
has on both executable file and the symbol table.

<A NAME="IDX425"></A>
<DT><CODE>exec-file [ <VAR>filename</VAR> ]</CODE>
<DD>
Specify that the program to be run (but not the symbol table) is found
in <VAR>filename</VAR>.  GDB searches the environment variable <CODE>PATH</CODE>
if necessary to locate your program.  Omitting <VAR>filename</VAR> means to
discard information on the executable file.

<A NAME="IDX426"></A>
<DT><CODE>symbol-file [ <VAR>filename</VAR> ]</CODE>
<DD>
Read symbol table information from file <VAR>filename</VAR>.  <CODE>PATH</CODE> is
searched when necessary.  Use the <CODE>file</CODE> command to get both symbol
table and program to run from the same file.

<CODE>symbol-file</CODE> with no argument clears out GDB information on your
program's symbol table.

The <CODE>symbol-file</CODE> command causes GDB to forget the contents 
of its convenience variables, the value history, and all breakpoints and
auto-display expressions.  This is because they may contain pointers to
the internal data recording symbols and data types, which are part of
the old symbol table data being discarded inside GDB.

<CODE>symbol-file</CODE> does not repeat if you press <KBD>RET</KBD> again after
executing it once.

When GDB is configured for a particular environment, it
understands debugging information in whatever format is the standard
generated for that environment; you may use either a GNU compiler, or
other compilers that adhere to the local conventions.  Best results are
usually obtained from GNU compilers; for example, using <CODE>gcc</CODE>
you can generate debugging information for optimized code.

On some kinds of object files, the <CODE>symbol-file</CODE> command does not
normally read the symbol table in full right away.  Instead, it scans
the symbol table quickly to find which source files and which symbols
are present.  The details are read later, one source file at a time,
as they are needed.

The purpose of this two-stage reading strategy is to make GDB start up
faster.  For the most part, it is invisible except for occasional
pauses while the symbol table details for a particular source file are
being read.  (The <CODE>set verbose</CODE> command can turn these pauses
into messages if desired.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC144">Optional warnings and messages</A>.) 

We have not implemented the two-stage strategy for COFF yet.  When the
symbol table is stored in COFF format, <CODE>symbol-file</CODE> reads the
symbol table data in full right away.

<DD>
<DT><CODE>file <VAR>filename</VAR> [ -readnow ] [ -mapped ]</CODE>
<DD>
You can override the GDB two-stage strategy for reading symbol
tables by using the <SAMP>`-readnow'</SAMP> option with any of the commands that
load symbol table information, if you want to be sure GDB has the
entire symbol table available.  

If memory-mapped files are available on your system through the
<CODE>mmap</CODE> system call, you can use another option, <SAMP>`-mapped'</SAMP>, to
cause GDB to write the symbols for your program into a reusable
file.  Future GDB debugging sessions map in symbol information
from this auxiliary symbol file (if the program has not changed), rather
than spending time reading the symbol table from the executable
program.  Using the <SAMP>`-mapped'</SAMP> option has the same effect as
starting GDB with the <SAMP>`-mapped'</SAMP> command-line option.

You can use both options together, to make sure the auxiliary symbol
file has all the symbol information for your program.

The auxiliary symbol file for a program called <VAR>myprog</VAR> is called
<SAMP>`<VAR>myprog</VAR>.syms'</SAMP>.  Once this file exists (so long as it is newer
than the corresponding executable), GDB always attempts to use
it when you debug <VAR>myprog</VAR>; no special options or commands are
needed.

The <TT>`.syms'</TT> file is specific to the host machine where you run
GDB.  It holds an exact image of the internal GDB
symbol table.  It cannot be shared across multiple host platforms.

<A NAME="IDX433"></A>
<A NAME="IDX434"></A>
<DT><CODE>core-file [ <VAR>filename</VAR> ]</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the whereabouts of a core dump file to be used as the "contents
of memory".  Traditionally, core files contain only some parts of the
address space of the process that generated them; GDB can access the
executable file itself for other parts.

<CODE>core-file</CODE> with no argument specifies that no core file is
to be used.

Note that the core file is ignored when your program is actually running
under GDB.  So, if you have been running your program and you wish to
debug a core file instead, you must kill the subprocess in which the
program is running.  To do this, use the <CODE>kill</CODE> command
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC23">Killing the child process</A>).

<A NAME="IDX435"></A>
<DT><CODE>load <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Depending on what remote debugging facilities are configured into
GDB, the <CODE>load</CODE> command may be available.  Where it exists, it
is meant to make <VAR>filename</VAR> (an executable) available for debugging
on the remote system--by downloading, or dynamic linking, for example.
<CODE>load</CODE> also records the <VAR>filename</VAR> symbol table in GDB, like
the <CODE>add-symbol-file</CODE> command.

If your GDB does not have a <CODE>load</CODE> command, attempting to
execute it gets the error message "<CODE>You can't do that when your
target is ...</CODE>"

The file is loaded at whatever address is specified in the executable.
For some object file formats, you can specify the load address when you
link the program; for other formats, like a.out, the object file format
specifies a fixed address.

On VxWorks, <CODE>load</CODE> links <VAR>filename</VAR> dynamically on the
current target system as well as adding its symbols in GDB.

<A NAME="IDX436"></A>
With the Nindy interface to an Intel 960 board, <CODE>load</CODE>
downloads <VAR>filename</VAR> to the 960 as well as adding its symbols in
GDB.

<A NAME="IDX437"></A>
<A NAME="IDX438"></A>
<A NAME="IDX439"></A>
<A NAME="IDX440"></A>
When you select remote debugging to a Hitachi SH, H8/300, or H8/500 board
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC132">GDB and Hitachi microprocessors</A>),
the <CODE>load</CODE> command downloads your program to the Hitachi board and also
opens it as the current executable target for GDB on your host
(like the <CODE>file</CODE> command).

<CODE>load</CODE> does not repeat if you press <KBD>RET</KBD> again after using it.

<A NAME="IDX441"></A>
<A NAME="IDX442"></A>
<DT><CODE>add-symbol-file <VAR>filename</VAR> <VAR>address</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>add-symbol-file <VAR>filename</VAR> <VAR>address</VAR> [ -readnow ] [ -mapped ]</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>add-symbol-file</CODE> command reads additional symbol table information
from the file <VAR>filename</VAR>.  You would use this command when <VAR>filename</VAR>
has been dynamically loaded (by some other means) into the program that
is running.  <VAR>address</VAR> should be the memory address at which the
file has been loaded; GDB cannot figure this out for itself.
You can specify <VAR>address</VAR> as an expression.

The symbol table of the file <VAR>filename</VAR> is added to the symbol table
originally read with the <CODE>symbol-file</CODE> command.  You can use the
<CODE>add-symbol-file</CODE> command any number of times; the new symbol data thus
read keeps adding to the old.  To discard all old symbol data instead,
use the <CODE>symbol-file</CODE> command.

<CODE>add-symbol-file</CODE> does not repeat if you press <KBD>RET</KBD> after using it.

You can use the <SAMP>`-mapped'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-readnow'</SAMP> options just as with
the <CODE>symbol-file</CODE> command, to change how GDB manages the symbol
table information for <VAR>filename</VAR>.

<CODE>add-shared-symbol-file</CODE>.  It takes no arguments.

<A NAME="IDX444"></A>
<DT><CODE>section</CODE>

section addresses, (such as in the a.out format), or when the addresses 
specified in the file itself are wrong.  Each section must be changed 
separately.  The "info files" command lists all the sections and their 
addresses.

currently in use by GDB, and the files from which symbols were
loaded.  The command <CODE>help target</CODE> lists all possible targets

<H2><A NAME="SEC100" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC100">Errors reading symbol files</A></H2>

<P>
While reading a symbol file, GDB occasionally encounters problems,
such as symbol types it does not recognize, or known bugs in compiler
output.  By default, GDB does not notify you of such problems, since
they are relatively common and primarily of interest to people
debugging compilers.  If you are interested in seeing information
about ill-constructed symbol tables, you can either ask GDB to print
only one message about each such type of problem, no matter how many
times the problem occurs; or you can ask GDB to print more messages,
to see how many times the problems occur, with the <CODE>set
complaints</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC144">Optional warnings and messages</A>).

</P>
<P>
The messages currently printed, and their meanings, include:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>inner block not inside outer block in <VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The symbol information shows where symbol scopes begin and end
(such as at the start of a function or a block of statements).  This
error indicates that an inner scope block is not fully contained
in its outer scope blocks.

GDB circumvents the problem by treating the inner block as if it had
the same scope as the outer block.  In the error message, <VAR>symbol</VAR>
may be shown as "<CODE>(don't know)</CODE>" if the outer block is not a
function.

<DT><CODE>block at <VAR>address</VAR> out of order</CODE>
<DD>
The symbol information for symbol scope blocks should occur in
order of increasing addresses.  This error indicates that it does not
do so.

GDB does not circumvent this problem, and has trouble
locating symbols in the source file whose symbols it is reading.  (You
can often determine what source file is affected by specifying
<CODE>set verbose on</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC144">Optional warnings and messages</A>.)

<DT><CODE>bad block start address patched</CODE>
<DD>
The symbol information for a symbol scope block has a start address
smaller than the address of the preceding source line.  This is known
to occur in the SunOS 4.1.1 (and earlier) C compiler.

GDB circumvents the problem by treating the symbol scope block as
starting on the previous source line.

<DT><CODE>bad string table offset in symbol <VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX452"></A>
Symbol number <VAR>n</VAR> contains a pointer into the string table which is
larger than the size of the string table.

GDB circumvents the problem by considering the symbol to have the
name <CODE>foo</CODE>, which may cause other problems if many symbols end up
with this name.

<DT><CODE>unknown symbol type <CODE>0x<VAR>nn</VAR></CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The symbol information contains new data types that GDB does not yet
know how to read.  <CODE>0x<VAR>nn</VAR></CODE> is the symbol type of the misunderstood
information, in hexadecimal.

GDB circumvents the error by ignoring this symbol information.  This
usually allows you to debug your program, though certain symbols
are not accessible.  If you encounter such a problem and feel like
debugging it, you can debug <CODE>gdb</CODE> with itself, breakpoint on
<CODE>complain</CODE>, then go up to the function <CODE>read_dbx_symtab</CODE> and
examine <CODE>*bufp</CODE> to see the symbol.

<DT><CODE>stub type has NULL name</CODE>
<DD>
GDB could not find the full definition for
a struct or class.

<DT><CODE>const/volatile indicator missing (ok if using g++ v1.x), got...</CODE>
<DD>
The symbol information for a C++ member function is missing some
information that recent versions of the compiler should have output
for it.

<DT><CODE>info mismatch between compiler and debugger</CODE>
<DD>
GDB could not parse a type specification output by the compiler.

</P>
<P>
A <STRONG>target</STRONG> is the execution environment occupied by your program.
Often, GDB runs in the same host environment as your program; in
that case, the debugging target is specified as a side effect when you
use the <CODE>file</CODE> or <CODE>core</CODE> commands.  When you need more
flexibility--for example, running GDB on a physically separate
host, or controlling a standalone system over a serial port or a
realtime system over a TCP/IP connection--you 
can use the <CODE>target</CODE> command to specify one of the target types
configured for GDB (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC103">Commands for managing targets</A>).

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC102" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC102">Active targets</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX455"></A>
<A NAME="IDX456"></A>
<A NAME="IDX457"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are three classes of targets: processes, core files, and
executable files.  GDB can work concurrently on up to three active
targets, one in each class.  This allows you to (for example) start a
process and inspect its activity without abandoning your work on a core
file.

</P>
<P>
For example, if you execute <SAMP>`gdb a.out'</SAMP>, then the executable file
<CODE>a.out</CODE> is the only active target.  If you designate a core file as
well--presumably from a prior run that crashed and coredumped--then
GDB has two active targets and uses them in tandem, looking
first in the corefile target, then in the executable file, to satisfy
requests for memory addresses.  (Typically, these two classes of target
are complementary, since core files contain only a program's
read-write memory--variables and so on--plus machine status, while
executable files contain only the program text and initialized data.)

</P>
<P>
When you type <CODE>run</CODE>, your executable file becomes an active process
target as well.  When a process target is active, all GDB commands
requesting memory addresses refer to that target; addresses in an 
active core file or 
executable file target are obscured while the process
target is active.

</P>
<P>
Use the <CODE>core-file</CODE> and <CODE>exec-file</CODE> commands to select a
new core file or executable target (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC99">Commands to specify files</A>).  To specify as a target a process that is already running, use
the <CODE>attach</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC22">Debugging an already-running process</A>).

<P>
<A NAME="IDX486"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you are trying to debug a program running on a machine that cannot run
GDB in the usual way, it is often useful to use remote debugging.  
For example, you might use remote debugging on an operating system kernel, 
or on a small system which does not have a general purpose operating system
powerful enough to run a full-featured debugger.

</P>
<P>
Some configurations of GDB have special serial or TCP/IP interfaces
to make this work with particular debugging targets.  In addition,
GDB comes with a generic serial protocol (specific to GDB, 
but not specific to any particular target system) which you can use if you
write the remote stubs--the code that runs on the remote system to
communicate with GDB.

</P>
<P>
Other remote targets may be available in your
configuration of GDB; use <CODE>help target</CODE> to list them.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX487"></A>
To debug a program running on another machine (the debugging
<STRONG>target</STRONG> machine), you must first arrange for all the usual
prerequisites for the program to run by itself.  For example, for a C
program, you need:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

A startup routine to set up the C runtime environment; these usually
have a name like <TT>`crt0'</TT>.  The startup routine may be supplied by
your hardware supplier, or you may have to write your own.

<LI>

You probably need a C subroutine library to support your program's
subroutine calls, notably managing input and output.

<LI>

A way of getting your program to the other machine--for example, a
download program.  These are often supplied by the hardware
manufacturer, but you may have to write your own from hardware
documentation.
</OL>

<P>
The next step is to arrange for your program to use a serial port to
communicate with the machine where GDB is running (the <STRONG>host</STRONG>
machine).  In general terms, the scheme looks like this:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>On the host,</EM>
<DD>
GDB already understands how to use this protocol; when everything
else is set up, you can simply use the <SAMP>`target remote'</SAMP> command
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC101">Specifying a Debugging Target</A>).

<DT><EM>On the target,</EM>
<DD>
you must link with your program a few special-purpose subroutines that
implement the GDB remote serial protocol.  The file containing these
subroutines is called  a <STRONG>debugging stub</STRONG>.

On certain remote targets, you can use an auxiliary program
<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> instead of linking a stub into your program.
See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC111">Using the <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> program</A>, for details.
</DL>

<P>
The debugging stub is specific to the architecture of the remote
machine; for example, use <TT>`sparc-stub.c'</TT> to debug programs on
SPARC boards.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX503"></A>
The debugging stub for your architecture supplies these three
subroutines:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set_debug_traps</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX504"></A>
<A NAME="IDX505"></A>
This routine arranges for <CODE>handle_exception</CODE> to run when your
program stops.  You must call this subroutine explicitly near the
beginning of your program.

<DT><CODE>handle_exception</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX506"></A>
<A NAME="IDX507"></A>
This is the central workhorse, but your program never calls it
explicitly--the setup code arranges for <CODE>handle_exception</CODE> to
run when a trap is triggered.

<CODE>handle_exception</CODE> takes control when your program stops during
execution (for example, on a breakpoint), and mediates communications
with GDB on the host machine.  This is where the communications
protocol is implemented; <CODE>handle_exception</CODE> acts as the GDB
representative on the target machine; it begins by sending summary
information on the state of your program, then continues to execute,
retrieving and transmitting any information GDB needs, until you
execute a GDB command that makes your program resume; at that point,
<CODE>handle_exception</CODE> returns control to your own code on the target
machine. 

<DT><CODE>breakpoint</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX508"></A>
Use this auxiliary subroutine to make your program contain a
breakpoint.  Depending on the particular situation, this may be the only
way for GDB to get control.  For instance, if your target
machine has some sort of interrupt button, you won't need to call this;
pressing the interrupt button transfers control to
<CODE>handle_exception</CODE>---in effect, to GDB.  On some machines,
simply receiving characters on the serial port may also trigger a trap;
again, in that situation, you don't need to call <CODE>breakpoint</CODE> from
your own program--simply running <SAMP>`target remote'</SAMP> from the host
GDB session gets control.  

Call <CODE>breakpoint</CODE> if none of these is true, or if you simply want
to make certain your program stops at a predetermined point for the
start of your debugging session.
</DL>



<H4><A NAME="SEC108" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC108">What you must do for the stub</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX509"></A>
The debugging stubs that come with GDB are set up for a particular
chip architecture, but they have no information about the rest of your
debugging target machine.

</P>
<P>
First of all you need to tell the stub how to communicate with the
serial port.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>int getDebugChar()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX510"></A>
Write this subroutine to read a single character from the serial port.
It may be identical to <CODE>getchar</CODE> for your target system; a
different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you wish.

<DT><CODE>void putDebugChar(int)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX511"></A>
Write this subroutine to write a single character to the serial port.
It may be identical to <CODE>putchar</CODE> for your target system; a 
different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you wish.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX512"></A>
<A NAME="IDX513"></A>
If you want GDB to be able to stop your program while it is
running, you need to use an interrupt-driven serial driver, and arrange
for it to stop when it receives a <CODE>^C</CODE> (<SAMP>`\003'</SAMP>, the control-C
character).  That is the character which GDB uses to tell the
remote system to stop.

</P>
<P>
Getting the debugging target to return the proper status to GDB
probably requires changes to the standard stub; one quick and dirty way
is to just execute a breakpoint instruction (the "dirty" part is that
GDB reports a <CODE>SIGTRAP</CODE> instead of a <CODE>SIGINT</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
Other routines you need to supply are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>void exceptionHandler (int <VAR>exception_number</VAR>, void *<VAR>exception_address</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX514"></A>
Write this function to install <VAR>exception_address</VAR> in the exception
handling tables.  You need to do this because the stub does not have any
way of knowing what the exception handling tables on your target system
are like (for example, the processor's table might be in ROM,
containing entries which point to a table in RAM).
<VAR>exception_number</VAR> is the exception number which should be changed;
its meaning is architecture-dependent (for example, different numbers
might represent divide by zero, misaligned access, etc).  When this
exception occurs, control should be transferred directly to
<VAR>exception_address</VAR>, and the processor state (stack, registers,
and so on) should be just as it is when a processor exception occurs.  So if
you want to use a jump instruction to reach <VAR>exception_address</VAR>, it
should be a simple jump, not a jump to subroutine.

For the 386, <VAR>exception_address</VAR> should be installed as an interrupt
gate so that interrupts are masked while the handler runs.  The gate
should be at privilege level 0 (the most privileged level).  The
SPARC and 68k stubs are able to mask interrup themselves without
help from <CODE>exceptionHandler</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>void flush_i_cache()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX515"></A>
(sparc and sparclite only) Write this subroutine to flush the
instruction cache, if any, on your target machine.  If there is no
instruction cache, this subroutine may be a no-op.

On target machines that have instruction caches, GDB requires this
function to make certain that the state of your program is stable.
</DL>

<P>
You must also make sure this library routine is available:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>void *memset(void *, int, int)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX516"></A>
This is the standard library function <CODE>memset</CODE> that sets an area of
memory to a known value.  If you have one of the free versions of
<CODE>libc.a</CODE>, <CODE>memset</CODE> can be found there; otherwise, you must
either obtain it from your hardware manufacturer, or write your own.
</DL>

<P>
If you do not use the GNU C compiler, you may need other standard
library subroutines as well; this varies from one stub to another,
but in general the stubs are likely to use any of the common library
subroutines which <CODE>gcc</CODE> generates as inline code.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC109" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC109">Putting it all together</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX517"></A>
In summary, when your program is ready to debug, you must follow these
steps.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Make sure you have the supporting low-level routines
(see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC108">What you must do for the stub</A>):

<PRE>
<CODE>getDebugChar</CODE>, <CODE>putDebugChar</CODE>,
<CODE>flush_i_cache</CODE>, <CODE>memset</CODE>, <CODE>exceptionHandler</CODE>.
</PRE>

<LI>

Insert these lines near the top of your program:


<PRE>
set_debug_traps();
breakpoint();
</PRE>

<LI>

For the 680x0 stub only, you need to provide a variable called
<CODE>exceptionHook</CODE>.  Normally you just use:


<PRE>
void (*exceptionHook)() = 0;
</PRE>

but if before calling <CODE>set_debug_traps</CODE>, you set it to point to a
function in your program, that function is called when
<CODE>GDB</CODE> continues after stopping on a trap (for example, bus
error).  The function indicated by <CODE>exceptionHook</CODE> is called with
one parameter: an <CODE>int</CODE> which is the exception number.

<LI>

Compile and link together: your program, the GDB debugging stub for
your target architecture, and the supporting subroutines.

<LI>

Make sure you have a serial connection between your target machine and
the GDB host, and identify the serial port on the host.

<LI>

Download your program to your target machine (or get it there by
whatever means the manufacturer provides), and start it.

<LI>

To start remote debugging, run GDB on the host machine, and specify
as an executable file the program that is running in the remote machine.
This tells GDB how to find your program's symbols and the contents
of its pure text.

<A NAME="IDX518"></A>
Then establish communication using the <CODE>target remote</CODE> command.
Its argument specifies how to communicate with the target
machine--either via a devicename attached to a direct serial line, or a
TCP port (usually to a terminal server which in turn has a serial line
to the target).  For example, to use a serial line connected to the
device named <TT>`/dev/ttyb'</TT>:


<PRE>
target remote /dev/ttyb
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX519"></A>
To use a TCP connection, use an argument of the form
<CODE><VAR>host</VAR>:port</CODE>.  For example, to connect to port 2828 on a
terminal server named <CODE>manyfarms</CODE>:


<PRE>
target remote manyfarms:2828
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
Now you can use all the usual commands to examine and change data and to
step and continue the remote program.

</P>
<P>
To resume the remote program and stop debugging it, use the <CODE>detach</CODE>
command.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX520"></A>
<A NAME="IDX521"></A>
Whenever GDB is waiting for the remote program, if you type the
interrupt character (often <KBD>C-C</KBD>), GDB attempts to stop the
program.  This may or may not succeed, depending in part on the hardware
and the serial drivers the remote system uses.  If you type the
interrupt character once again, GDB displays this prompt:

</P>

<PRE>
Interrupted while waiting for the program.
Give up (and stop debugging it)?  (y or n)
</PRE>

<P>
If you type <KBD>y</KBD>, GDB abandons the remote debugging session.
(If you decide you want to try again later, you can use <SAMP>`target
remote'</SAMP> again to connect once more.)  If you type <KBD>n</KBD>, GDB
goes back to waiting.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX522"></A>
<A NAME="IDX523"></A>
<A NAME="IDX524"></A>
The stub files provided with GDB implement the target side of the
communication protocol, and the GDB side is implemented in the
GDB source file <TT>`remote.c'</TT>.  Normally, you can simply allow
these subroutines to communicate, and ignore the details.  (If you're
implementing your own stub file, you can still ignore the details: start
with one of the existing stub files.  <TT>`sparc-stub.c'</TT> is the best
organized, and therefore the easiest to read.)

</P>
<P>
However, there may be occasions when you need to know something about
the protocol--for example, if there is only one serial port to your
target machine, you might want your program to do something special if
it recognizes a packet meant for GDB.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX525"></A>
<A NAME="IDX526"></A>
<A NAME="IDX527"></A>
All GDB commands and responses (other than acknowledgements, which
are single characters) are sent as a packet which includes a
checksum.  A packet is introduced with the character <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>, and ends
with the character <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> followed by a two-digit checksum:

</P>

<PRE>
$<VAR>packet info</VAR>#<VAR>checksum</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX528"></A>
<VAR>checksum</VAR> is computed as the modulo 256 sum of the <VAR>packet
info</VAR> characters.

</P>
<P>
When either the host or the target machine receives a packet, the first
response expected is an acknowledgement: a single character, either
<SAMP>`+'</SAMP> (to indicate the package was received correctly) or <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>
(to request retransmission).

</P>
<P>
The host (GDB) sends commands, and the target (the debugging stub
incorporated in your program) sends data in response.  The target also
sends data when your program stops.

</P>
<P>
Command packets are distinguished by their first character, which
identifies the kind of command.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX533"></A>
<A NAME="IDX534"></A>
<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> is a control program for Unix-like systems, which
allows you to connect your program with a remote GDB via
<CODE>target remote</CODE>---but without linking in the usual debugging stub.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> is not a complete replacement for the debugging stubs,
because it requires essentially the same operating-system facilities
that GDB itself does.  In fact, a system that can run
<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> to connect to a remote GDB could also run
GDB locally!  <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> is sometimes useful nevertheless,
because it is a much smaller program than GDB itself.  It is
also easier to port than all of GDB, so you may be able to get
started more quickly on a new system by using <CODE>gdbserver</CODE>.
Finally, if you develop code for real-time systems, you may find that
the tradeoffs involved in real-time operation make it more convenient to
do as much development work as possible on another system, for example
by cross-compiling.  You can use <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> to make a similar
choice for debugging.

</P>
<P>
GDB and <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> communicate via either a serial line
or a TCP connection, using the standard GDB remote serial
protocol.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>On the target machine,</EM>
<DD>
you need to have a copy of the program you want to debug.
<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> does not need your program's symbol table, so you can
strip the program if necessary to save space.  GDB on the host
system does all the symbol handling.

To use the server, you must tell it how to communicate with GDB;
the name of your program; and the arguments for your program.  The
syntax is:


<PRE>
target&#62; gdbserver <VAR>comm</VAR> <VAR>program</VAR> [ <VAR>args</VAR> ... ]
</PRE>

<VAR>comm</VAR> is either a device name (to use a serial line) or a TCP
hostname and portnumber.  For example, to debug Emacs with the argument
<SAMP>`foo.txt'</SAMP> and communicate with GDB over the serial port
<TT>`/dev/com1'</TT>:


<PRE>
target&#62; gdbserver /dev/com1 emacs foo.txt
</PRE>

<CODE>gdbserver</CODE> waits passively for the host GDB to communicate
with it.

To use a TCP connection instead of a serial line:


<PRE>
target&#62; gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt
</PRE>

The only difference from the previous example is the first argument,
specifying that you are communicating with the host GDB via
TCP.  The <SAMP>`host:2345'</SAMP> argument means that <CODE>gdbserver</CODE> is to
expect a TCP connection from machine <SAMP>`host'</SAMP> to local TCP port 2345.
(Currently, the <SAMP>`host'</SAMP> part is ignored.)  You can choose any number
you want for the port number as long as it does not conflict with any
TCP ports already in use on the target system (for example, <CODE>23</CODE> is
reserved for <CODE>telnet</CODE>).<A NAME="DOCF3" HREF="gdb_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A> You must use the same port number with the host GDB
<CODE>target remote</CODE> command.

<DT><EM>On the GDB host machine,</EM>
<DD>
you need an unstripped copy of your program, since GDB needs
symbols and debugging information.  Start up GDB as usual,
using the name of the local copy of your program as the first argument.
(You may also need the <SAMP>`--baud'</SAMP> option if the serial line is
running at anything other than 9600 bps.)  After that, use <CODE>target
remote</CODE> to establish communications with <CODE>gdbserver</CODE>.  Its argument
is either a device name (usually a serial device, like
<TT>`/dev/ttyb'</TT>), or a TCP port descriptor in the form
<CODE><VAR>host</VAR>:<VAR>PORT</VAR></CODE>.  For example:


<PRE>
(gdb) target remote /dev/ttyb
</PRE>

communicates with the server via serial line <TT>`/dev/ttyb'</TT>, and

<P>
<A NAME="IDX535"></A>
<CODE>gdbserve.nlm</CODE> is a control program for NetWare systems, which
allows you to connect your program with a remote GDB via
<CODE>target remote</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
GDB and <CODE>gdbserve.nlm</CODE> communicate via a serial line,
using the standard GDB remote serial protocol.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>On the target machine,</EM>
<DD>
you need to have a copy of the program you want to debug.
<CODE>gdbserve.nlm</CODE> does not need your program's symbol table, so you
can strip the program if necessary to save space.  GDB on the
host system does all the symbol handling.

To use the server, you must tell it how to communicate with
GDB; the name of your program; and the arguments for your
program.  The syntax is:


<PRE>
load gdbserve [ BOARD=<VAR>board</VAR> ] [ PORT=<VAR>port</VAR> ]
              [ BAUD=<VAR>baud</VAR> ] <VAR>program</VAR> [ <VAR>args</VAR> ... ]
</PRE>

<VAR>board</VAR> and <VAR>port</VAR> specify the serial line; <VAR>baud</VAR> specifies
the baud rate used by the connection.  <VAR>port</VAR> and <VAR>node</VAR> default
to 0, <VAR>baud</VAR> defaults to 9600 bps.

For example, to debug Emacs with the argument <SAMP>`foo.txt'</SAMP>and
communicate with GDB over serial port number 2 or board 1 
using a 19200 bps connection:


<PRE>
load gdbserve BOARD=1 PORT=2 BAUD=19200 emacs foo.txt
</PRE>

<DT><EM>On the GDB host machine,</EM>
<DD>
you need an unstripped copy of your program, since GDB needs
symbols and debugging information.  Start up GDB as usual,
using the name of the local copy of your program as the first argument.
(You may also need the <SAMP>`--baud'</SAMP> option if the serial line is
running at anything other than 9600 bps.  After that, use <CODE>target
remote</CODE> to establish communications with <CODE>gdbserve.nlm</CODE>.  Its
argument is a device name (usually a serial device, like
<TT>`/dev/ttyb'</TT>).  For example:


<PRE>
(gdb) target remote /dev/ttyb
</PRE>

communications with the server via serial line <TT>`/dev/ttyb'</TT>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX542"></A>
<A NAME="IDX543"></A>

</P>
<P>
AMD distributes a 29K development board meant to fit in a PC, together
with a DOS-hosted monitor program called <CODE>EBMON</CODE>.  As a shorthand
term, this development system is called the "EB29K".  To use
GDB from a Unix system to run programs on the EB29K board, you
must first connect a serial cable between the PC (which hosts the EB29K
board) and a serial port on the Unix system.  In the following, we
assume you've hooked the cable between the PC's <TT>`COM1'</TT> port and
<TT>`/dev/ttya'</TT> on the Unix system.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC119" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC119">Communications setup</A></H4>

<P>
The next step is to set up the PC's port, by doing something like this
in DOS on the PC:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; MODE com1:9600,n,8,1,none
</PRE>

<P>
This example--run on an MS DOS 4.0 system--sets the PC port to 9600
bps, no parity, eight data bits, one stop bit, and no "retry" action;
you must match the communications parameters when establishing the Unix
end of the connection as well.

</P>
<P>
To give control of the PC to the Unix side of the serial line, type
the following at the DOS console:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; CTTY com1
</PRE>

<P>
(Later, if you wish to return control to the DOS console, you can use
the command <CODE>CTTY con</CODE>---but you must send it over the device that
had control, in our example over the <TT>`COM1'</TT> serial line).

</P>
<P>
From the Unix host, use a communications program such as <CODE>tip</CODE> or
<CODE>cu</CODE> to communicate with the PC; for example,

</P>

<PRE>
cu -s 9600 -l /dev/ttya
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>cu</CODE> options shown specify, respectively, the linespeed and the
serial port to use.  If you use <CODE>tip</CODE> instead, your command line
may look something like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
tip -9600 /dev/ttya
</PRE>

<P>
Your system may require a different name where we show
<TT>`/dev/ttya'</TT> as the argument to <CODE>tip</CODE>.  The communications
parameters, including which port to use, are associated with the
<CODE>tip</CODE> argument in the "remote" descriptions file--normally the
system table <TT>`/etc/remote'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX544"></A>
Using the <CODE>tip</CODE> or <CODE>cu</CODE> connection, change the DOS working
directory to the directory containing a copy of your 29K program, then
start the PC program <CODE>EBMON</CODE> (an EB29K control program supplied
with your board by AMD).  You should see an initial display from
<CODE>EBMON</CODE> similar to the one that follows, ending with the

<P>
For this example, we've assumed what is probably the most convenient
way to make sure the same 29K program is on both the PC and the Unix
system: a PC/NFS connection that establishes "drive <CODE>G:</CODE>" on the
PC as a file system on the Unix host.  If you do not have PC/NFS or
something similar connecting the two systems, you must arrange some
other way--perhaps floppy-disk transfer--of getting the 29K program
from the Unix system to the PC; GDB does <EM>not</EM> download it over the
serial line.

</P>

<P>
Finally, <CODE>cd</CODE> to the directory containing an image of your 29K
program on the Unix system, and start GDB---specifying as argument the
name of your 29K program:

</P>

<PRE>
cd /usr/joe/work29k
gdb myfoo
</PRE>

<P>
Now you can use the <CODE>target</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
target amd-eb /dev/ttya 9600 MYFOO
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, we've assumed your program is in a file called
<TT>`myfoo'</TT>.  Note that the filename given as the last argument to
<CODE>target amd-eb</CODE> should be the name of the program as it appears to DOS.
In our example this is simply <CODE>MYFOO</CODE>, but in general it can include
a DOS path, and depending on your transfer mechanism may not resemble
the name on the Unix side.

</P>
<P>
At this point, you can set any breakpoints you wish; when you are ready
to see your program run on the 29K board, use the GDB command
<CODE>run</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To stop debugging the remote program, use the GDB <CODE>detach</CODE>
command.

</P>
<P>
To return control of the PC to its console, use <CODE>tip</CODE> or <CODE>cu</CODE>
once again, after your GDB session has concluded, to attach to
<CODE>EBMON</CODE>.  You can then type the command <CODE>q</CODE> to shut down
<CODE>EBMON</CODE>, returning control to the DOS command-line interpreter.
Type <CODE>CTTY con</CODE> to return command input to the main DOS console,
and type <KBD>~.</KBD> to leave <CODE>tip</CODE> or <CODE>cu</CODE>.

If you have connected to the VxWorks target and you want to debug an
object that has not yet been loaded, you can use the GDB
<CODE>load</CODE> command to download a file from Unix to VxWorks
incrementally.  The object file given as an argument to the <CODE>load</CODE>
command is actually opened twice: first by the VxWorks target in order
to download the code, then by GDB in order to read the symbol
table.  This can lead to problems if the current working directories on
the two systems differ.  If both systems have NFS mounted the same
filesystems, you can avoid these problems by using absolute paths.
Otherwise, it is simplest to set the working directory on both systems
to the directory in which the object file resides, and then to reference
the file by its name, without any path.  For instance, a program
<TT>`prog.o'</TT> may reside in <TT>`<VAR>vxpath</VAR>/vw/demo/rdb'</TT> in VxWorks
and in <TT>`<VAR>hostpath</VAR>/vw/demo/rdb'</TT> on the host.  To load this

this makes GDB delete all currently-defined breakpoints,

Once connected to the Sparclet target, 
you can use the GDB
<CODE>load</CODE> command to download the file from the host to the target.
The file name and load offset should be given as arguments to the <CODE>load</CODE>
command.
Since the file format is aout, the program must be loaded to the starting 
address.  You can use objdump to find out what this value is.  The load
offset is an offset which is added to the VMA (virtual memory address)
of each of the file's sections.
For instance, if the program
<TT>`prog'</TT> was linked to text address 0x1201000, with data at 0x12010160
and bss at 0x12010170, in GDB, type:

Use the special <CODE>gdb</CODE> command <SAMP>`device <VAR>port</VAR>'</SAMP> if you
need to explicitly set the serial device.  The default <VAR>port</VAR> is the

<P>
<A NAME="IDX565"></A>
<A NAME="IDX566"></A>
<CODE>gdb</CODE> has another special command to set the communications
speed: <SAMP>`speed <VAR>bps</VAR>'</SAMP>.  This command also is only used from Unix
hosts; on DOS hosts, set the line speed as usual from outside GDB with
the DOS <KBD>mode</KBD> command (for instance, <SAMP>`mode
com2:9600,n,8,1,p'</SAMP> for a 9600 bps connection).

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`device'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`speed'</SAMP> commands are available only when you
use a Unix host to debug your Hitachi microprocessor programs.  If you
use a DOS host,
GDB depends on an auxiliary terminate-and-stay-resident program
called <CODE>asynctsr</CODE> to communicate with the development board
through a PC serial port.  You must also use the DOS <CODE>mode</CODE> command
to set up the serial port on the DOS side.

<H3><A NAME="SEC136" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC136">GDB and remote MIPS boards</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX572"></A>
GDB can use the MIPS remote debugging protocol to talk to a
MIPS board attached to a serial line.  This is available when
you configure GDB with <SAMP>`--target=mips-idt-ecoff'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Use these GDB commands to specify the connection to your target board:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>target mips <VAR>port</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX573"></A>
To run a program on the board, start up <CODE>gdb</CODE> with the
name of your program as the argument.  To connect to the board, use the
command <SAMP>`target mips <VAR>port</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>port</VAR> is the name of
the serial port connected to the board.  If the program has not already
been downloaded to the board, you may use the <CODE>load</CODE> command to
download it.  You can then use all the usual GDB commands.

For example, this sequence connects to the target board through a serial
port, and loads and runs a program called <VAR>prog</VAR> through the
debugger:


<PRE>
host$ gdb <VAR>prog</VAR>
GDB is free software and ...
(gdb) target mips /dev/ttyb
(gdb) load <VAR>prog</VAR>

<SAMP>`<VAR>hostname</VAR>:<VAR>portnumber</VAR>'</SAMP>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set processor <VAR>args</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>show processor</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX577"></A>
<A NAME="IDX578"></A>
Use the <CODE>set processor</CODE> command to set the type of MIPS
processor when you want to access processor-type-specific registers.
For example, <CODE>set processor <VAR>r3041</VAR></CODE> tells GDB 
to use the CPO registers appropriate for the 3041 chip.
Use the <CODE>show processor</CODE> command to see what MIPS processor GDB 
is using.  Use the <CODE>info reg</CODE> command to see what registers
GDB is using. 

<DT><CODE>set mipsfpu double</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX579"></A>
<A NAME="IDX580"></A>
<A NAME="IDX581"></A>
<A NAME="IDX582"></A>
If your target board does not support the MIPS floating point
coprocessor, you should use the command <SAMP>`set mipsfpu none'</SAMP> (if you
need this, you may wish to put the command in your .gdbinit
file).  This tells GDB how to find the return value of
functions which return floating point values.  It also allows
GDB to avoid saving the floating point registers when calling
functions on the board.  If you are using a floating point coprocessor
with only single precision floating point support, as on the R4650
processor, use the command <SAMP>`set mipsfpu single'</SAMP>.  The default
double precision floating point coprocessor may be selected using
<SAMP>`set mipsfpu double'</SAMP>.

In previous versions the only choices were double precision or no
floating point, so <SAMP>`set mipsfpu on'</SAMP> will select double precision
and <SAMP>`set mipsfpu off'</SAMP> will select no floating point.

As usual, you can inquire about the <CODE>mipsfpu</CODE> variable with
<SAMP>`show mipsfpu'</SAMP>.

You can see some debugging information about communications with the board
by setting the <CODE>remotedebug</CODE> variable.  If you set it to <CODE>1</CODE> using
<SAMP>`set remotedebug 1'</SAMP>, every packet is displayed.  If you set it
to <CODE>2</CODE>, every character is displayed.  You can check the current value
at any time with the command <SAMP>`show remotedebug'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX589"></A>
<A NAME="IDX590"></A>
<A NAME="IDX591"></A>
<A NAME="IDX592"></A>
You can control the timeout used while waiting for a packet, in the MIPS
remote protocol, with the <CODE>set timeout <VAR>seconds</VAR></CODE> command.  The
default is 5 seconds.  Similarly, you can control the timeout used while
waiting for an acknowledgement of a packet with the <CODE>set
retransmit-timeout <VAR>seconds</VAR></CODE> command.  The default is 3 seconds.
You can inspect both values with <CODE>show timeout</CODE> and <CODE>show
retransmit-timeout</CODE>.  (These commands are <EM>only</EM> available when
GDB is configured for <SAMP>`--target=mips-idt-ecoff'</SAMP>.)

The timeout set by <CODE>set timeout</CODE> does not apply when GDB
is waiting for your program to stop.  In that case, GDB waits
forever because it has no way of knowing how long the program is going
to run before stopping.

<P>
Certain commands to GDB may produce large amounts of
information output to the screen.  To help you read all of it,
GDB pauses and asks you for input at the end of each page of
output.  Type <KBD>RET</KBD> when you want to continue the output, or <KBD>q</KBD>
to discard the remaining output.  Also, the screen width setting
determines when to wrap lines of output.  Depending on what is being
printed, GDB tries to break the line at a readable place,
rather than simply letting it overflow onto the following line.

</P>
<P>
Normally GDB knows the size of the screen from the termcap data base
together with the value of the <CODE>TERM</CODE> environment variable and the

<DT><CODE>set verbose off</CODE>
<DD>
Disables GDB output of certain informational messages.

<A NAME="IDX636"></A>
<DT><CODE>show verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Displays whether <CODE>set verbose</CODE> is on or off.
</DL>

<P>
By default, if GDB encounters bugs in the symbol table of an object
file, it is silent; but if you are debugging a compiler, you may find
this information useful (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC100">Errors reading symbol files</A>).

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set complaints <VAR>limit</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX637"></A>
 
Permits GDB to output <VAR>limit</VAR> complaints about each type of unusual
symbols before becoming silent about the problem.  Set <VAR>limit</VAR> to
zero to suppress all complaints; set it to a large number to prevent
complaints from being suppressed.

<A NAME="IDX638"></A>
<DT><CODE>show complaints</CODE>
<DD>
Displays how many symbol complaints GDB is permitted to produce.
</DL>

<P>
By default, GDB is cautious, and asks what sometimes seems to be a
lot of stupid questions to confirm certain commands.  For example, if
you try to run a program which is already running:

</P>

<PRE>
(gdb) run
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n)
</PRE>

<P>
If you are willing to unflinchingly face the consequences of your own
commands, you can disable this "feature":

<A NAME="IDX643"></A>
<DT><CODE>show confirm</CODE>
<DD>
Displays state of confirmation requests.
</DL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC145" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC145">Canned Sequences of Commands</A></H1>

<P>
Aside from breakpoint commands (see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC35">Breakpoint command lists</A>), GDB provides two ways to store sequences of commands
for execution as a unit: user-defined commands and command files.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC146" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC146">User-defined commands</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX644"></A>
A <STRONG>user-defined command</STRONG> is a sequence of GDB commands to which 
you assign a new name as a command.  This is done with the <CODE>define</CODE>
command.  User commands may accept up to 10 arguments separated by whitespace.
Arguments are accessed within the user command via <VAR>$arg0...$arg9</VAR>.
A trivial example:

</P>

<PRE>
define adder
  print $arg0 + $arg1 + $arg2
</PRE>

<P>
To execute the command use:

</P>

<PRE>
adder 1 2 3
</PRE>

<P>
This defines the command <CODE>adder</CODE>, which prints the sum of
its three arguments.  Note the arguments are text substitutions, so they may 
reference variables, use complex expressions, or even perform inferior
functions calls.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>define <VAR>commandname</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX645"></A>
 
Define a command named <VAR>commandname</VAR>.  If there is already a command
by that name, you are asked to confirm that you want to redefine it.

The definition of the command is made up of other GDB command lines,
which are given following the <CODE>define</CODE> command.  The end of these
commands is marked by a line containing <CODE>end</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX646"></A>
<A NAME="IDX647"></A>
<DT><CODE>if</CODE>
<DD>
Takes a single argument, which is an expression to evaluate.
It is followed by a series of commands that are executed
only if the expression is true (nonzero).
There can then optionally be a line <CODE>else</CODE>, followed
by a series of commands that are only executed if the expression
was false.  The end of the list is marked by a line containing <CODE>end</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX648"></A>
<DT><CODE>while</CODE>
<DD>
The syntax is similar to <CODE>if</CODE>: the command takes a single argument,
which is an expression to evaluate, and must be followed by the commands to
execute, one per line, terminated by an <CODE>end</CODE>.
The commands are executed repeatedly as long as the expression
evaluates to true.

<A NAME="IDX649"></A>
<DT><CODE>document <VAR>commandname</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Document the user-defined command <VAR>commandname</VAR>, so that it can be
accessed by <CODE>help</CODE>.  The command <VAR>commandname</VAR> must already be 
defined.  This command reads lines of documentation just as <CODE>define</CODE> 
reads the lines of the command definition, ending with <CODE>end</CODE>.  
After the <CODE>document</CODE> command is finished, <CODE>help</CODE> on command 
<VAR>commandname</VAR> displays the documentation you have written.

You may use the <CODE>document</CODE> command again to change the
documentation of a command.  Redefining the command with <CODE>define</CODE>
does not change the documentation.

<A NAME="IDX650"></A>
<DT><CODE>help user-defined</CODE>
<DD>
List all user-defined commands, with the first line of the documentation
(if any) for each.

<A NAME="IDX651"></A>
<DT><CODE>show user</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>show user <VAR>commandname</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Display the GDB commands used to define <VAR>commandname</VAR> (but not its
documentation).  If no <VAR>commandname</VAR> is given, display the
definitions for all user-defined commands.
</DL>

<P>
When user-defined commands are executed, the
commands of the definition are not printed.  An error in any command
stops execution of the user-defined command.

</P>
<P>
If used interactively, commands that would ask for confirmation proceed
without asking when used inside a user-defined command.  Many GDB 
commands that normally print messages to say what they are doing omit the 
messages when used in a user-defined command.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC147" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC147">User-defined command hooks</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX652"></A>

</P>
<P>
You may define <EM>hooks</EM>, which are a special kind of user-defined
command.  Whenever you run the command <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>, if the user-defined
command <SAMP>`hook-foo'</SAMP> exists, it is executed (with no arguments)
before that command.

</P>
<P>
In addition, a pseudo-command, <SAMP>`stop'</SAMP> exists.  Defining
(<SAMP>`hook-stop'</SAMP>) makes the associated commands execute every time
execution stops in your program: before breakpoint commands are run,
displays are printed, or the stack frame is printed.

</P>
<P>
For example, to ignore <CODE>SIGALRM</CODE> signals while
single-stepping, but treat them normally during normal execution,
you could define:

</P>

<PRE>
define hook-stop
handle SIGALRM nopass
end

define hook-run
handle SIGALRM pass
end

define hook-continue
handle SIGLARM pass
end
</PRE>

<P>
You can define a hook for any single-word command in GDB, but
not for command aliases; you should define a hook for the basic command
name, e.g.  <CODE>backtrace</CODE> rather than <CODE>bt</CODE>.
If an error occurs during the execution of your hook, execution of
GDB commands stops and GDB issues a prompt
(before the command that you actually typed had a chance to run).

</P>
<P>
If you try to define a hook which does not match any known command, you
get a warning from the <CODE>define</CODE> command.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC148" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC148">Command files</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX653"></A>
A command file for GDB is a file of lines that are GDB 
commands.  Comments (lines starting with <KBD>#</KBD>) may also be included.  
An empty line in a command file does nothing; it does not mean to repeat 
the last command, as it would from the terminal.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX654"></A>
<A NAME="IDX655"></A>
When you start GDB, it automatically executes commands from its
<STRONG>init files</STRONG>.  These are files named <TT>`.gdbinit'</TT>.
GDB reads the init file (if any) in your home directory, then
processes command line options and operands, and then reads the init
file (if any) in the current working directory.  This is so the init
file in your home directory can set options (such as <CODE>set
complaints</CODE>) which affect the processing of the command line options and
operands.  The init files are not executed if you use the <SAMP>`-nx'</SAMP>
option; see section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC8">Choosing modes</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX656"></A>
On some configurations of GDB, the init file is known by a
different name (these are typically environments where a specialized
form of GDB may need to coexist with other forms, 
hence a different name
for the specialized version's init file).  These are the environments
with special init file names:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX657"></A>

<UL>
<LI>

VxWorks (Wind River Systems real-time OS): <SAMP>`.vxgdbinit'</SAMP>

<A NAME="IDX658"></A>
<LI>

OS68K (Enea Data Systems real-time OS): <SAMP>`.os68gdbinit'</SAMP>

<A NAME="IDX659"></A>
<LI>

ES-1800 (Ericsson Telecom AB M68000 emulator): <SAMP>`.esgdbinit'</SAMP>
</UL>

<P>
You can also request the execution of a command file with the
<CODE>source</CODE> command:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>source <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX660"></A>
 
Execute the command file <VAR>filename</VAR>.
</DL>

<P>
The lines in a command file are executed sequentially.  They are not
printed as they are executed.  An error in any command terminates execution
of the command file.

</P>
<P>
Commands that would ask for confirmation if used interactively proceed
without asking when used in a command file.  Many GDB commands that
normally print messages to say what they are doing omit the messages
when called from command files.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC149" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC149">Commands for controlled output</A></H2>

<P>
During the execution of a command file or a user-defined command, normal
GDB output is suppressed; the only output that appears is what is
explicitly printed by the commands in the definition.  This section
describes three commands useful for generating exactly the output you
want.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>echo <VAR>text</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX661"></A>
 
Print <VAR>text</VAR>.  Nonprinting characters can be included in
<VAR>text</VAR> using C escape sequences, such as <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP> to print a
newline.  <STRONG>No newline is printed unless you specify one.</STRONG>
In addition to the standard C escape sequences, a backslash followed
by a space stands for a space.  This is useful for displaying a
string with spaces at the beginning or the end, since leading and
trailing spaces are otherwise trimmed from all arguments.  
To print <SAMP>` and foo = '</SAMP>, use the command
<SAMP>`echo \ and foo = \ '</SAMP>.

A backslash at the end of <VAR>text</VAR> can be used, as in C, to continue
the command onto subsequent lines.  For example,


<PRE>
echo This is some text\n\
which is continued\n\
onto several lines.\n
</PRE>

produces the same output as


<PRE>
echo This is some text\n
echo which is continued\n
echo onto several lines.\n
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX662"></A>
<DT><CODE>output <VAR>expression</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print the value of <VAR>expression</VAR> and nothing but that value: no
newlines, no <SAMP>`$<VAR>nn</VAR> = '</SAMP>.  The value is not entered in the
value history either.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>, for more information 
on expressions.

<DT><CODE>output/<VAR>fmt</VAR> <VAR>expression</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print the value of <VAR>expression</VAR> in format <VAR>fmt</VAR>.  You can use
the same formats as for <CODE>print</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gdb.html#SEC55">Output formats</A>, for more information.

<A NAME="IDX663"></A>
<DT><CODE>printf <VAR>string</VAR>, <VAR>expressions</VAR>...</CODE>
<DD>
Print the values of the <VAR>expressions</VAR> under the control of
<VAR>string</VAR>.  The <VAR>expressions</VAR> are separated by commas and may be
either numbers or pointers.  Their values are printed as specified by
<VAR>string</VAR>, exactly as if your program were to execute the C
subroutine


<PRE>
printf (<VAR>string</VAR>, <VAR>expressions</VAR>...);
</PRE>

For example, you can print two values in hex like this:


<PRE>
printf "foo, bar-foo = 0x%x, 0x%x\n", foo, bar-foo
</PRE>

The only backslash-escape sequences that you can use in the format
string are the simple ones that consist of backslash followed by a
letter.
</DL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC150" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC150">Using GDB under GNU Emacs</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX664"></A>
<A NAME="IDX665"></A>
A special interface allows you to use GNU Emacs to view (and
edit) the source files for the program you are debugging with
GDB.

</P>
<P>
To use this interface, use the command <KBD>M-x gdb</KBD> in Emacs.  Give the
executable file you want to debug as an argument.  This command starts
GDB as a subprocess of Emacs, with input and output through a newly
created Emacs buffer.

</P>
<P>
Using GDB under Emacs is just like using GDB normally except for two
things:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All "terminal" input and output goes through the Emacs buffer.
</UL>

<P>
This applies both to GDB commands and their output, and to the input
and output done by the program you are debugging.

</P>
<P>
This is useful because it means that you can copy the text of previous
commands and input them again; you can even use parts of the output
in this way.

</P>
<P>
All the facilities of Emacs' Shell mode are available for interacting
with your program.  In particular, you can send signals the usual
way--for example, <KBD>C-c C-c</KBD> for an interrupt, <KBD>C-c C-z</KBD> for a
stop.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

GDB displays source code through Emacs.
</UL>

<P>
Each time GDB displays a stack frame, Emacs automatically finds the
source file for that frame and puts an arrow (<SAMP>`=&#62;'</SAMP>) at the
left margin of the current line.  Emacs uses a separate buffer for
source display, and splits the screen to show both your GDB session
and the source.

</P>
<P>
Explicit GDB <CODE>list</CODE> or search commands still produce output as
usual, but you probably have no reason to use them from Emacs.

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> If the directory where your program resides is not your
current directory, it can be easy to confuse Emacs about the location of
the source files, in which case the auxiliary display buffer does not
appear to show your source.  GDB can find programs by searching your
environment's <CODE>PATH</CODE> variable, so the GDB input and output
session proceeds normally; but Emacs does not get enough information
back from GDB to locate the source files in this situation.  To
avoid this problem, either start GDB mode from the directory where
your program resides, or specify an absolute file name when prompted for the
<KBD>M-x gdb</KBD> argument.

</P>
<P>
A similar confusion can result if you use the GDB <CODE>file</CODE> command to
switch to debugging a program in some other location, from an existing
GDB buffer in Emacs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
By default, <KBD>M-x gdb</KBD> calls the program called <TT>`gdb'</TT>.  If
you need to call GDB by a different name (for example, if you keep
several configurations around, with different names) you can set the
Emacs variable <CODE>gdb-command-name</CODE>; for example,

</P>

<PRE>
(setq gdb-command-name "mygdb")
</PRE>

<P>
(preceded by <KBD>ESC ESC</KBD>, or typed in the <CODE>*scratch*</CODE> buffer, or
in your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file) makes Emacs call the program named
"<CODE>mygdb</CODE>" instead.

</P>
<P>
In the GDB I/O buffer, you can use these special Emacs commands in
addition to the standard Shell mode commands:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-h m</KBD>
<DD>
Describe the features of Emacs' GDB Mode.

<DT><KBD>M-s</KBD>
<DD>
Execute to another source line, like the GDB <CODE>step</CODE> command; also
update the display window to show the current file and location.

<DT><KBD>M-n</KBD>
<DD>
Execute to next source line in this function, skipping all function
calls, like the GDB <CODE>next</CODE> command.  Then update the display window
to show the current file and location.

<DT><KBD>M-i</KBD>
<DD>
Execute one instruction, like the GDB <CODE>stepi</CODE> command; update
display window accordingly.

<DT><KBD>M-x gdb-nexti</KBD>
<DD>
Execute to next instruction, using the GDB <CODE>nexti</CODE> command; update
display window accordingly.

<DT><KBD>C-c C-f</KBD>
<DD>
Execute until exit from the selected stack frame, like the GDB
<CODE>finish</CODE> command.

<DT><KBD>M-c</KBD>
<DD>
Continue execution of your program, like the GDB <CODE>continue</CODE>
command.

<EM>Warning:</EM> In Emacs v19, this command is <KBD>C-c C-p</KBD>.

<DT><KBD>M-u</KBD>
<DD>
Go up the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument
(see section `Numeric Arguments' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Manual</CITE>),
like the GDB <CODE>up</CODE> command.

<EM>Warning:</EM> In Emacs v19, this command is <KBD>C-c C-u</KBD>.

<DT><KBD>M-d</KBD>
<DD>
Go down the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument, like the
GDB <CODE>down</CODE> command.

<EM>Warning:</EM> In Emacs v19, this command is <KBD>C-c C-d</KBD>.

<DT><KBD>C-x &#38;</KBD>
<DD>
Read the number where the cursor is positioned, and insert it at the end
of the GDB I/O buffer.  For example, if you wish to disassemble code
around an address that was displayed earlier, type <KBD>disassemble</KBD>;
then move the cursor to the address display, and pick up the
argument for <CODE>disassemble</CODE> by typing <KBD>C-x &#38;</KBD>.

You can customize this further by defining elements of the list
<CODE>gdb-print-command</CODE>; once it is defined, you can format or
otherwise process numbers picked up by <KBD>C-x &#38;</KBD> before they are
inserted.  A numeric argument to <KBD>C-x &#38;</KBD> indicates that you
wish special formatting, and also acts as an index to pick an element of the
list.  If the list element is a string, the number to be inserted is
formatted using the Emacs function <CODE>format</CODE>; otherwise the number
is passed as an argument to the corresponding list element.
</DL>

<P>
In any source file, the Emacs command <KBD>C-x SPC</KBD> (<CODE>gdb-break</CODE>)
tells GDB to set a breakpoint on the source line point is on.

</P>
<P>
If you accidentally delete the source-display buffer, an easy way to get
it back is to type the command <CODE>f</CODE> in the GDB buffer, to
request a frame display; when you run under Emacs, this recreates
the source buffer if necessary to show you the context of the current
frame.

</P>
<P>
The source files displayed in Emacs are in ordinary Emacs buffers
which are visiting the source files in the usual way.  You can edit
the files with these buffers if you wish; but keep in mind that GDB
communicates with Emacs in terms of line numbers.  If you add or
delete lines from the text, the line numbers that GDB knows cease
to correspond properly with the code.

</P>

Your bug reports play an essential role in making GDB reliable.

</P>

Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem, or it

the entire community by making the next version of GDB work better.  Bug
reports are your contribution to the maintenance of GDB.

<A NAME="IDX669"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX670"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX671"></A>
 
If the debugger gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that is a

<A NAME="IDX672"></A>
<LI>

If GDB produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.

<A NAME="IDX673"></A>
<LI>

If GDB does not produce an error message for invalid input,
that is a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of
"invalid input" might be our idea of "an extension" or "support
for traditional practice".

<LI>

If you are an experienced user of debugging tools, your suggestions
for improvement of GDB are welcome in any case.

<P>
A number of companies and individuals offer support for GNU products.
If you obtained GDB from a support organization, we recommend you
contact that organization first.

</P>
<P>
You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file <TT>`etc/SERVICE'</TT> in the GNU Emacs
distribution.

</P>
<P>
In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for GDB to one
of these addresses:

<PRE>
bug-gdb@prep.ai.mit.edu
{ucbvax|mit-eddie|uunet}!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gdb
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Do not send bug reports to <SAMP>`info-gdb'</SAMP>, or to
<SAMP>`help-gdb'</SAMP>, or to any newsgroups.</STRONG> Most users of GDB do not want to
receive bug reports.  Those that do have arranged to receive <SAMP>`bug-gdb'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The mailing list <SAMP>`bug-gdb'</SAMP> has a newsgroup <SAMP>`gnu.gdb.bug'</SAMP> which
serves as a repeater.  The mailing list and the newsgroup carry exactly
the same messages.  Often people think of posting bug reports to the
newsgroup instead of mailing them.  This appears to work, but it has one
problem which can be crucial: a newsgroup posting often lacks a mail
path back to the sender.  Thus, if we need to ask for more information,
we may be unable to reach you.  For this reason, it is better to send
bug reports to the mailing list.

</P>
<P>
As a last resort, send bug reports on paper to:

</P>

<PRE>
GNU Debugger Bugs
Free Software Foundation Inc.
59 Temple Place - Suite 330
Boston, MA 02111-1307
USA
</PRE>

<P>
The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
<STRONG>report all the facts</STRONG>.  If you are not sure whether to state a
fact or leave it out, state it!

</P>
<P>
Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of the variable you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug is a
stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location where that
name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were different, the contents
of that location would fool the debugger into doing the right thing despite
the bug.  Play it safe and give a specific, complete example.  That is the
easiest thing for you to do, and the most helpful.

</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug if it is new to us.  
Therefore, always write your bug reports on
the assumption that the bug has not been reported previously.

</P>
<P>
Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  Those bug reports are useless, and we urge everyone to
<EM>refuse to respond to them</EM> except to chide the sender to report
bugs properly.

</P>
<P>
To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The version of GDB.  GDB announces it if you start with no
arguments; you can also print it at any time using <CODE>show version</CODE>.

Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in looking for
the bug in the current version of GDB.

<LI>

The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and
version number.

<LI>

What compiler (and its version) was used to compile GDB---e.g.
"gcc--2.0".

<LI>

What compiler (and its version) was used to compile the program you
are debugging--e.g.  "gcc--2.0".

<LI>

The command arguments you gave the compiler to compile your example and
observe the bug.  For example, did you use <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>?  To guarantee
you will not omit something important, list them all.  A copy of the
Makefile (or the output from make) is sufficient.

If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess wrong
and then we might not encounter the bug.

<LI>

A complete input script, and all necessary source files, that will
reproduce the bug.

<LI>

A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, "It gets a fatal signal."

Of course, if the bug is that GDB gets a fatal signal, then we will
certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we might not
notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well not give us a 
chance to make a mistake.

Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still
say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on, such as,
your copy of GDB is out of synch, or you have encountered a
bug in the C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your copy
might crash and ours would not.  If you told us to expect a crash,
then when ours fails to crash, we would know that the bug was not
happening for us.  If you had not told us to expect a crash, then we
would not be able to draw any conclusion from our observations.

<LI>

If you wish to suggest changes to the GDB source, send us context
diffs.  If you even discuss something in the GDB source, refer to
it by context, not by line number.

The line numbers in our development sources will not match those in your
sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful information to us.
</UL>

<P>
Here are some things that are not necessary:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A description of the envelope of the bug.

Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
changes will not affect it.

This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way we
will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger
with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples.
We recommend that you save your time for something else.

Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report <EM>instead</EM>
of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
less time, and so on.

However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do this,
report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you used.

<LI>

A patch for the bug.

A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not omit
the necessary information, such as the test case, on the assumption that
a patch is all we need.  We might see problems with your patch and decide
to fix the problem another way, or we might not understand it at all.

Sometimes with a program as complicated as GDB it is very hard to
construct an example that will make the program follow a certain path
through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will not be able
to construct one, so we will not be able to verify that the bug is fixed.

And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why your
patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A test case will
help us to understand.

<LI>

A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about such
things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

<H1><A NAME="SEC154" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC154">Formatting Documentation</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX676"></A>
<A NAME="IDX677"></A>
The GDB 4 release includes an already-formatted reference card, ready
for printing with PostScript or Ghostscript, in the <TT>`gdb'</TT>
subdirectory of the main source directory<A NAME="DOCF4" HREF="gdb_foot.html#FOOT4">(4)</A>.  If you can use PostScript or Ghostscript with your printer,
you can print the reference card immediately with <TT>`refcard.ps'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
The release also includes the source for the reference card.  You
can format it, using TeX, by typing:

</P>

<PRE>
make refcard.dvi
</PRE>

<P>
The GDB reference card is designed to print in <STRONG>landscape</STRONG> 
mode on US "letter" size paper; 
that is, on a sheet 11 inches wide by 8.5 inches
high.  You will need to specify this form of printing as an option to
your DVI output program.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX678"></A>

</P>
<P>
All the documentation for GDB comes as part of the machine-readable
distribution.  The documentation is written in Texinfo format, which is
a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce both
on-line information and a printed manual.  You can use one of the Info
formatting commands to create the on-line version of the documentation
and TeX (or <CODE>texi2roff</CODE>) to typeset the printed version.

</P>
<P>
GDB includes an already formatted copy of the on-line Info version of
this manual in the <TT>`gdb'</TT> subdirectory.  The main Info file is
<TT>`gdb-version-number/gdb/gdb.info'</TT>, and it refers to
subordinate files matching <SAMP>`gdb.info*'</SAMP> in the same directory.  If
necessary, you can print out these files, or read them with any editor;
but they are easier to read using the <CODE>info</CODE> subsystem in GNU Emacs
or the standalone <CODE>info</CODE> program, available as part of the GNU
Texinfo distribution.

</P>
<P>
If you want to format these Info files yourself, you need one of the
Info formatting programs, such as <CODE>texinfo-format-buffer</CODE> or
<CODE>makeinfo</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you have <CODE>makeinfo</CODE> installed, and are in the top level GDB
source directory (<TT>`gdb-'</TT>, in the case of version ), you can
make the Info file by typing:

</P>

<PRE>
cd gdb
make gdb.info
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to typeset and print copies of this manual, you need TeX,
a program to print its DVI output files, and <TT>`texinfo.tex'</TT>, the
Texinfo definitions file.

</P>
<P>
TeX is a typesetting program; it does not print files directly, but
produces output files called DVI files.  To print a typeset
document, you need a program to print DVI files.  If your system
has TeX installed, chances are it has such a program.  The precise
command to use depends on your system; <KBD>lpr -d</KBD> is common; another
(for PostScript devices) is <KBD>dvips</KBD>.  The DVI print command may
require a file name without any extension or a <SAMP>`.dvi'</SAMP> extension.

</P>
<P>
TeX also requires a macro definitions file called
<TT>`texinfo.tex'</TT>.  This file tells TeX how to typeset a document
written in Texinfo format.  On its own, TeX cannot either read or
typeset a Texinfo file.  <TT>`texinfo.tex'</TT> is distributed with GDB
and is located in the <TT>`gdb-<VAR>version-number</VAR>/texinfo'</TT>
directory.

</P>
<P>
If you have TeX and a DVI printer program installed, you can
typeset and print this manual.  First switch to the the <TT>`gdb'</TT>
subdirectory of the main source directory (for example, to
<TT>`gdb-/gdb'</TT>) and then type:

</P>

<PRE>
make gdb.dvi
</PRE>



<H1><A NAME="SEC155" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC155">Installing GDB</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX679"></A>
<A NAME="IDX680"></A>

</P>
<P>
GDB comes with a <CODE>configure</CODE> script that automates the process
of preparing GDB for installation; you can then use <CODE>make</CODE> to
build the <CODE>gdb</CODE> program.
<A NAME="DOCF5" HREF="gdb_foot.html#FOOT5">(5)</A>

</P>
<P>
The GDB distribution includes all the source code you need for 
GDB in a single directory, whose name is usually composed by 
appending the version number to <SAMP>`gdb'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
For example, the GDB version  distribution is in the
<TT>`gdb-'</TT> directory.  That directory contains:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>gdb-/configure (and supporting files)</CODE>
<DD>
script for configuring GDB and all its supporting libraries

<DT><CODE>gdb-/gdb</CODE>
<DD>
the source specific to GDB itself

<DT><CODE>gdb-/bfd</CODE>
<DD>
source for the Binary File Descriptor library

<DT><CODE>gdb-/include</CODE>
<DD>
GNU include files

<DT><CODE>gdb-/libiberty</CODE>
<DD>
source for the <SAMP>`-liberty'</SAMP> free software library

<DT><CODE>gdb-/opcodes</CODE>
<DD>
source for the library of opcode tables and disassemblers

<DT><CODE>gdb-/readline</CODE>
<DD>
source for the GNU command-line interface

<DT><CODE>gdb-/glob</CODE>
<DD>
source for the GNU filename pattern-matching subroutine

<DT><CODE>gdb-/mmalloc</CODE>
<DD>
source for the GNU memory-mapped malloc package
</DL>

<P>
The simplest way to configure and build GDB is to run <CODE>configure</CODE>
from the <TT>`gdb-<VAR>version-number</VAR>'</TT> source directory, which in
this example is the <TT>`gdb-'</TT> directory.

</P>
<P>
First switch to the <TT>`gdb-<VAR>version-number</VAR>'</TT> source directory
if you are not already in it; then run <CODE>configure</CODE>.  Pass the
identifier for the platform on which GDB will run as an
argument.

</P>
<P>
For example:

</P>

<PRE>
cd gdb-
./configure <VAR>host</VAR>
make
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>host</VAR> is an identifier such as <SAMP>`sun4'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`decstation'</SAMP>, that identifies the platform where GDB will run.
(You can often leave off <VAR>host</VAR>; <CODE>configure</CODE> tries to guess the
correct value by examining your system.)

</P>
<P>
Running <SAMP>`configure <VAR>host</VAR>'</SAMP> and then running <CODE>make</CODE> builds the
<TT>`bfd'</TT>, <TT>`readline'</TT>, <TT>`mmalloc'</TT>, and <TT>`libiberty'</TT>
libraries, then <CODE>gdb</CODE> itself.  The configured source files, and the
binaries, are left in the corresponding source directories.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>configure</CODE> is a Bourne-shell (<CODE>/bin/sh</CODE>) script; if your
system does not recognize this automatically when you run a different
shell, you may need to run <CODE>sh</CODE> on it explicitly:

</P>

<PRE>
sh configure <VAR>host</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
If you run <CODE>configure</CODE> from a directory that contains source
directories for multiple libraries or programs, such as the
<TT>`gdb-'</TT> source directory for version , <CODE>configure</CODE>
creates configuration files for every directory level underneath (unless
you tell it not to, with the <SAMP>`--norecursion'</SAMP> option).

</P>
<P>
You can run the <CODE>configure</CODE> script from any of the
subordinate directories in the GDB distribution if you only want to
configure that subdirectory, but be sure to specify a path to it.

</P>
<P>
For example, with version , type the following to configure only
the <CODE>bfd</CODE> subdirectory:

</P>

<PRE>
cd gdb-/bfd
../configure <VAR>host</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
You can install <CODE>gdb</CODE> anywhere; it has no hardwired paths.
However, you should make sure that the shell on your path (named by
the <SAMP>`SHELL'</SAMP> environment variable) is publicly readable.  Remember
that GDB uses the shell to start your program--some systems refuse to
let GDB debug child processes whose programs are not readable.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC156" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC156">Compiling GDB in another directory</A></H2>

<P>
If you want to run GDB versions for several host or target machines,
you need a different <CODE>gdb</CODE> compiled for each combination of
host and target.  <CODE>configure</CODE> is designed to make this easy by
allowing you to generate each configuration in a separate subdirectory,
rather than in the source directory.  If your <CODE>make</CODE> program
handles the <SAMP>`VPATH'</SAMP> feature (GNU <CODE>make</CODE> does), running
<CODE>make</CODE> in each of these directories builds the <CODE>gdb</CODE>
program specified there.

</P>
<P>
To build <CODE>gdb</CODE> in a separate directory, run <CODE>configure</CODE>
with the <SAMP>`--srcdir'</SAMP> option to specify where to find the source.
(You also need to specify a path to find <CODE>configure</CODE>
itself from your working directory.  If the path to <CODE>configure</CODE>
would be the same as the argument to <SAMP>`--srcdir'</SAMP>, you can leave out
the <SAMP>`--srcdir'</SAMP> option; it is assumed.)

</P>
<P>
For example, with version , you can build GDB in a 
separate directory for a Sun 4 like this:

</P>

<PRE>
cd gdb-
mkdir ../gdb-sun4
cd ../gdb-sun4
../gdb-/configure sun4
make
</PRE>

<P>
When <CODE>configure</CODE> builds a configuration using a remote source
directory, it creates a tree for the binaries with the same structure
(and using the same names) as the tree under the source directory.  In
the example, you'd find the Sun 4 library <TT>`libiberty.a'</TT> in the
directory <TT>`gdb-sun4/libiberty'</TT>, and GDB itself in
<TT>`gdb-sun4/gdb'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
One popular reason to build several GDB configurations in separate
directories is to configure GDB for cross-compiling (where 
GDB runs on one machine--the <STRONG>host</STRONG>---while debugging 
programs that run on another machine--the <STRONG>target</STRONG>).  
You specify a cross-debugging target by
giving the <SAMP>`--target=<VAR>target</VAR>'</SAMP> option to <CODE>configure</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When you run <CODE>make</CODE> to build a program or library, you must run
it in a configured directory--whatever directory you were in when you
called <CODE>configure</CODE> (or one of its subdirectories).

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>Makefile</CODE> that <CODE>configure</CODE> generates in each source
directory also runs recursively.  If you type <CODE>make</CODE> in a source
directory such as <TT>`gdb-'</TT> (or in a separate configured
directory configured with <SAMP>`--srcdir=<VAR>dirname</VAR>/gdb-'</SAMP>), you
will build all the required libraries, and then build GDB.

</P>
<P>
When you have multiple hosts or targets configured in separate
directories, you can run <CODE>make</CODE> on them in parallel (for example,
if they are NFS-mounted on each of the hosts); they will not interfere
with each other.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC157" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC157">Specifying names for hosts and targets</A></H2>

<P>
The specifications used for hosts and targets in the <CODE>configure</CODE>
script are based on a three-part naming scheme, but some short predefined
aliases are also supported.  The full naming scheme encodes three pieces
of information in the following pattern:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>architecture</VAR>-<VAR>vendor</VAR>-<VAR>os</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
For example, you can use the alias <CODE>sun4</CODE> as a <VAR>host</VAR> argument,
or as the value for <VAR>target</VAR> in a <CODE>--target=<VAR>target</VAR></CODE>
option.  The equivalent full name is <SAMP>`sparc-sun-sunos4'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>configure</CODE> script accompanying GDB does not provide
any query facility to list all supported host and target names or
aliases.  <CODE>configure</CODE> calls the Bourne shell script
<CODE>config.sub</CODE> to map abbreviations to full names; you can read the
script, if you wish, or you can use it to test your guesses on
abbreviations--for example:

</P>

<PRE>
% sh config.sub sun4
sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1
% sh config.sub sun3
m68k-sun-sunos4.1.1
% sh config.sub decstation
mips-dec-ultrix4.2
% sh config.sub hp300bsd
m68k-hp-bsd
% sh config.sub i386v
i386-unknown-sysv
% sh config.sub i786v
Invalid configuration `i786v': machine `i786v' not recognized
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>config.sub</CODE> is also distributed in the GDB source
directory (<TT>`gdb-'</TT>, for version ).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC158" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC158"><CODE>configure</CODE> options</A></H2>

<P>
Here is a summary of the <CODE>configure</CODE> options and arguments that
are most often useful for building GDB.  <CODE>configure</CODE> also has
several other options not listed here.  See Info file `configure.info', node `What Configure Does', for a full explanation of <CODE>configure</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>
configure [--help]

          [--norecursion] [--rm]
          [--target=<VAR>target</VAR>] <VAR>host</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
You may introduce options with a single <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> rather than
<SAMP>`--'</SAMP> if you prefer; but you may abbreviate option names if you use
<SAMP>`--'</SAMP>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Display a quick summary of how to invoke <CODE>configure</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-prefix=<VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>

Configure the source to install programs and files under directory
<TT>`<VAR>dir</VAR>'</TT>.

<DT><CODE>--srcdir=<VAR>dirname</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<STRONG>Warning: using this option requires GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, or another
<CODE>make</CODE> that implements the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> feature.</STRONG><BR>
Use this option to make configurations in directories separate from the
GDB source directories.  Among other things, you can use this to
build (or maintain) several configurations simultaneously, in separate
directories.  <CODE>configure</CODE> writes configuration specific files in
the current directory, but arranges for them to use the source in the
directory <VAR>dirname</VAR>.  <CODE>configure</CODE> creates directories under
the working directory in parallel to the source directories below
<VAR>dirname</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>--norecursion</CODE>
<DD>
Configure only the directory level where <CODE>configure</CODE> is executed; do not
propagate configuration to subdirectories.

<DT><CODE>--rm</CODE>
<DD>
<EM>Remove</EM> files otherwise built during configuration.

<DT><CODE>--target=<VAR>target</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Configure GDB for cross-debugging programs running on the specified
<VAR>target</VAR>.  Without this option, GDB is configured to debug
programs that run on the same machine (<VAR>host</VAR>) as GDB itself.

There is no convenient way to generate a list of all available targets.

<DT><CODE><VAR>host</VAR> ...</CODE>
<DD>
Configure GDB to run on the specified <VAR>host</VAR>.

There is no convenient way to generate a list of all available hosts.
</DL>

<P>
<CODE>configure</CODE> accepts other options, for compatibility with
configuring other GNU tools recursively; but these are the only
options that affect GDB or its supporting libraries.
