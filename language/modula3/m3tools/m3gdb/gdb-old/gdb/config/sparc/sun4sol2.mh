# If you are compiling with Sun's compiler, add the -xs option to CC
# (e.g. `make CC="cc -xs"').
# Sun's compilers require the -xs option to produce debug information
# in the final linked executable.  Otherwise they leave it in the .o
# files only, with undocumented pointers to it in the linked executable.
# This is commented out because we don't assume that the Sun compiler
# is in use.
