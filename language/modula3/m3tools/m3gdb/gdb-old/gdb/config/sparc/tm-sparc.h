/* Describe the pointer in each stack frame to the previous stack frame
   (its caller).  */

/* FRAME_CHAIN takes a frame's nominal address
   and produces the frame's chain-pointer. */

/* In the case of the Sun 4, the frame-chain's nominal address
   is held in the frame pointer register.

   On the Sun4, the frame (in %fp) is %sp for the previous frame.
   From the previous frame's %sp, we can find the previous frame's
   %fp: it is in the save area just above the previous frame's %sp.

   If we are setting up an arbitrary frame, we'll need to know where
   it ends.  Hence the following.  This part of the frame cache
   structure should be checked before it is assumed that this frame's
   bottom is in the stack pointer.

   If there isn't a frame below this one, the bottom of this frame is
   in the stack pointer.

   If there is a frame below this one, and the frame pointers are
   identical, it's a leaf frame and the bottoms are the same also.

   Otherwise the bottom of this frame is the top of the next frame.

   The bottom field is misnamed, since it might imply that memory from
   bottom to frame contains this frame.  That need not be true if
   stack frames are allocated in different segments (e.g. some on a
   stack, some on a heap in the data segment).

   GCC 2.6 and later can generate ``flat register window'' code that
   makes frames by explicitly saving those registers that need to be
   saved.  %i7 is used as the frame pointer, and the frame is laid out so
   that flat and non-flat calls can be intermixed freely within a
   program.  Unfortunately for GDB, this means it must detect and record
   the flatness of frames.

   Since the prologue in a flat frame also tells us where fp and pc
   have been stashed (the frame is of variable size, so their location
   is not fixed), it's convenient to record them in the frame info.  */

   note that this is 192 bytes, which is a multiple of 8 (not only 4) bytes.
   note that the `call' insn is a relative, not an absolute call.
   note that the `nop' at the end is needed to keep the trap from
        clobbering things (if NPC pointed to garbage instead).

We actually start executing at the `sethi', since the pushing of the
registers (as arguments) is done by PUSH_DUMMY_FRAME.  If this were
real code, the arguments for the function called by the CALL would be
pushed between the list of ST insns and the CALL, and we could allow
it to execute through.  But the arguments have to be pushed by GDB
after the PUSH_DUMMY_FRAME is done, and we cannot allow these ST
insns to be performed again, lest the registers saved be taken for
arguments.  */
