   The dummy decides if the target is in text space or data space. If
   it's in data space, there's no problem because the target can
   return back to the dummy. However, if the target is in text space,
   the dummy calls the secret, undocumented routine _sr4export, which
   calls a function in text space and can return to any space. Instead
   of including fake instructions to represent saved registers, we
   know that the frame is associated with the call dummy and treat it
   specially.

   The trailing NOPs are needed to avoid a bug in HPUX, BSD and OSF1 
   kernels.   If the memory at the location pointed to by the PC is
   0xffffffff then a ptrace step call will fail (even if the instruction
   is nullified).

   The code to pop a dummy frame single steps three instructions
   starting with the last mtsp.  This includes the nullified "instruction"
   following the ble (which is uninitialized junk).  If the 
   "instruction" following the last BLE is 0xffffffff, then the ptrace
   will fail and the dummy frame is not correctly popped.

   By placing a NOP in the delay slot of the BLE instruction we can be 
   sure that we never try to execute a 0xffffffff instruction and
   avoid the kernel bug.  The second NOP is needed to keep the call
   dummy 8 byte aligned.  */
