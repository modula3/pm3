/* The following text is taken from config/rs6000.mh:
 * # The IBM version of /usr/include/rpc/rpc.h has a bug -- it says
 * # `extern fd_set svc_fdset;' without ever defining the type fd_set.
 * # Unfortunately this occurs in the vx-share code, which is not configured
 * # like the rest of GDB (e.g. it doesn't include "defs.h").
 * # We circumvent this bug by #define-ing fd_set here, but undefining it in
 * # the xm-rs6000.h file before ordinary modules try to use it.  FIXME, IBM!
 * MH_CFLAGS='-Dfd_set=int'
 * So, here we do the undefine...which has to occur before we include
 * <sys/select.h> below.
