/* Traditional Unix virtual address spaces have thre regions: text,
   data and stack.  The text, initialised data, and uninitialised data
   are represented in separate segments of the a.out file.
   When a process dumps core, the data and stack regions are written
   to a core file.  This gives a debugger enough information to
   reconstruct (and debug) the virtual address space at the time of
   the coredump.
   Pyramids have an distinct fourth region of the virtual address
   space, in which the contents of the windowed registers are stacked
   in fixed-size frames.  Pyramid refer to this region as the control
   stack.  Each call (or trap) automatically allocates a new register
   frame; each return deallocates the current frame and restores the
   windowed registers to their values before the call.

   When dumping core, the control stack is written to a core files as
   a third segment. The core-handling functions need to know to deal
   with it. */
