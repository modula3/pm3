SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

	Given a pointer to one of the shared objects in our list

	relocate all the section addresses by the base address at
	which the shared object was mapped.

FIXMES

	In most (all?) cases the shared object file name recorded in the
	dynamic linkage tables will be a fully qualified pathname.  For
	cases where it isn't, do we really mimic the systems search
	mechanism correctly in the below code (particularly the tilde

LOCAL FUNCTION

	locate_base -- locate the base address of dynamic linker structs

SYNOPSIS

	CORE_ADDR locate_base (void)

DESCRIPTION

	For both the SunOS and SVR4 shared library implementations, if the
	inferior executable has been linked dynamically, there is a single
	address somewhere in the inferior's data space which is the key to
	locating all of the dynamic linker's runtime structures.  This
	address is the value of the symbol defined by the macro DEBUG_BASE.
	The job of this function is to find and return that address, or to
	return 0 if there is no such address (the executable is statically
	linked for example).

	For SunOS, the job is almost trivial, since the dynamic linker and
	all of it's structures are statically linked to the executable at
	link time.  Thus the symbol for the address we are looking for has
	already been added to the minimal symbol table for the executable's
	objfile at the time the symbol file's symbols were read, and all we
	have to do is look it up there.  Note that we explicitly do NOT want
	to find the copies in the shared library.

	The SVR4 version is much more complicated because the dynamic linker
	and it's structures are located in the shared C library, which gets
	run as the executable's "interpreter" by the kernel.  We have to go
	to a lot more work to discover the address of DEBUG_BASE.  Because
	of this complexity, we cache the value we find and return that value
	on subsequent invocations.  Note there is no copy in the executable
	symbol tables.

	Irix 5 is basically like SunOS.

	Note that we can assume nothing about the process state at the time
	we need to find this address.  We may be stopped on the first instruc-
	tion of the interpreter (C shared library), the first instruction of
	the executable itself, or somewhere else entirely (if we attached
	to the process for example).

SYNOPSIS

	This module contains the routine which finds the names of any

	NULL on the first call, and then the returned value must be passed
	in on subsequent calls. This provides the capability to "step" down
	the list of loaded objects. On the last object, a NULL value is
	returned.

GLOBAL FUNCTION
  
	solib_create_inferior_hook -- shared library startup support
  
SYNOPSIS
  
	void solib_create_inferior_hook()
  
DESCRIPTION
  
	When gdb starts up the inferior, it nurses it along (through the
	shell) until it is ready to execute it's first instruction.  At this
	point, this function gets called via expansion of the macro
	SOLIB_CREATE_INFERIOR_HOOK.

	For SunOS executables, this first instruction is typically the
	one at "_start", or a similar text label, regardless of whether
	the executable is statically or dynamically linked.  The runtime
	startup code takes care of dynamically linking in any shared
	libraries, once gdb allows the inferior to continue.

	For SVR4 executables, this first instruction is either the first
	instruction in the dynamic linker (for dynamically linked
	executables) or the instruction at "start" for statically linked
	executables.  For dynamically linked executables, the system
	first exec's /lib/libc.so.N, which contains the dynamic linker,
	and starts it running.  The dynamic linker maps in any needed
	shared libraries, maps in the actual user executable, and then
	jumps to "start" in the user executable.

	For both SunOS shared libraries, and SVR4 shared libraries, we
	can arrange to cooperate with the dynamic linker to discover the
	names of shared libraries that are dynamically linked, and the
	base addresses to which they are linked.

	This function is responsible for discovering those names and
	addresses, and saving sufficient information about them to allow
	their symbols to be read at a later time.

FIXME

	Between enable_break() and disable_break(), this code does not
	properly handle hitting breakpoints which the user might have
	set in the startup code or in the dynamic linker itself.  Proper
	handling will probably have to wait until the implementation is
	changed to use the "breakpoint handler function" method.

	Also, what if child has exit()ed?  Must exit loop somehow.
