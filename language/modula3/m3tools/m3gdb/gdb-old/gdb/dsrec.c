 *        is one of:
 *        0) header record
 *        1) two byte address data record
 *        2) three byte address data record

 *        9) two byte address termination record
 *       
 *      - address
 *        is the start address of the data following, or in the case of
 *        a termination record, the start address of the image
 *      - data
 *        is the data.
 *      - checksum
 *	  is the sum of all the raw byte data in the record, from the length
 *        upwards, modulo 256 and subtracted from 255.
 *
 * This routine returns the length of the S-record.
