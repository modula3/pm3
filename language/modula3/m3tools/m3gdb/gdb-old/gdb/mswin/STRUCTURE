The src window on the user's screen contains classes like this.

(CSrcSplit
(CTabView)
((CSrcScroll1)
 (CSrcScroll1)))

We only keep one CSrcD object, which contains all the source
information in the file.

Clicking around the srcwindow thing will just change the bits
of the CSrcD which are displayed.
