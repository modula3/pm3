   use a mapped symbol file for this file, so create a new one if one does
   not currently exist.

   If found, then return an open file descriptor for the file, otherwise
   return -1.

   This routine is responsible for implementing the policy that generates
   the name of the mapped symbol file from the name of a file containing
   symbols that gdb would like to read.  Currently this policy is to append
   ".syms" to the name of the file.

   This routine is also responsible for implementing the policy that
   determines where the mapped symbol file is found (the search path).
   This policy is that when reading an existing mapped file, a file of
   the correct name in the current directory takes precedence over a
   file of the correct name in the same directory as the symbol file.
   When creating a new mapped file, it is always created in the current
   directory.  This helps to minimize the chances of a user unknowingly
   creating big mapped files in places like /bin and /usr/local/bin, and
   allows a local copy to override a manually installed global copy (in
   /bin for example).  */
