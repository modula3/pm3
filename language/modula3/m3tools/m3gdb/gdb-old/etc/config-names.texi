@c this text is included into install.texi, relnotes.texi, and rebuilding.texi

Your tape is labeled to indicate the host (and target, if applicable)
for which the binaries in the distribution are configured.  The
specifications used for hosts and targets in the @code{configure} script
are based on a three-part naming scheme, though the scheme is slightly
different between hosts and targets.

@menu
* Host names::
* config.guess::
@ifset cdk
* Target names::
@end ifset
@end menu

@node Host names
@unnumberedsubsec Host names

The full naming scheme for hosts encodes three pieces of information in
the following pattern:

@smallexample
@var{architecture}-@var{vendor}-@var{os}
@end smallexample

For example, the full name for a Sun @sc{sparc}station running SunOS
4.1.4 is

@smallexample
sparc-sun-sunos4.1.4
@end smallexample

@ifclear INSTALL
Remember that you can type @code{configure} without specifying a
@var{hosttype} and your host will be divined by @code{configure}
(@pxref{config.guess,,@code{config.guess}}).  In fact, we recommend this
procedure on most systems.
@end ifclear

@quotation
@emph{Warning:} @code{configure} can represent a very large number of
combinations of architecture, vendor, and operating system.  There is by
no means support for all possible combinations!
@end quotation

The following combinations refer to hosts supported by Cygnus Support.
The OS versions shown are the versions under which this release was
built.  If you have any questions regarding compatibility, please feel
free to contact Cygnus Support.

@node Target names
@unnumberedsubsec Target names

If you have a cross-development tape, the label also indicates the
target for that configuration.  The pattern for target names is

@smallexample
@var{architecture}[-@var{vendor}]-@var{objfmt}
@end smallexample

Target names differ slightly from host names in that the last variable
indicates the object format rather than the operating system, and the
second variable is often left out (this practice is becoming obsolete;
in the future, all configuration names will be made up of three parts).

In cross-development configurations, each tool in the Developer's Kit is
installed with the configured name of the target as a prefix.  For
example, if the C compiler is configured to generate @sc{coff} format
code for the Motorola 680x0 family, the compiler is installed as
@file{m68k-coff-gcc}.

@quotation
@emph{Warning:} @code{configure} can represent a very large number of
target name combinations of architecture, vendor, and object format.
There is by no means support for all possible combinations!
@end quotation

This is a list of some of the more common targets supported by Cygnus
Support.  (Not all targets are supported on every host!)  The list is
not exhaustive; see @ref{Introduction,,Overview,relnotes,Release Notes},
for an up-to-date matrix which shows the host/target combinations
supported by Cygnus.  Also, see the manual @ref{Embed with GNU,,Embed
with GNU,embed,Embedded Systems Programming}.

@node config.guess
@unnumberedsubsec @code{config.guess}

@code{config.guess} is a shell script which attempts to deduce the host
type from which it is called, using system commands like @code{uname} if
they are available.  @code{config.guess} is remarkably adept at
deciphering the proper configuration for your host; if you are building
a tree to run on the same host on which you're building it, we recommend
@emph{not} specifying the @var{hosttype} argument.

@code{config.guess} is called by @code{configure}; you need never run it
by hand, unless you're curious about the output.
