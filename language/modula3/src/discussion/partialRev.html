<H1>Partial Revelation and Modula-3</H1>
<H2>Importing Only Necessary Class Features</H2>
<P>
<H2>by Steve Freeman</H2>
<P>
Proponents of object-oriented programming claim that it provides 
at least two benefits: code reuse and encapsulation. These 
features, however, often conflict, as it is difficult to reuse 
something that is hidden, and most statically typed, object-
oriented languages (those in which the type of expressions and 
variables can be determined at compile time) require that 
visibility and inheritance information be described early in the 
class hierarchy. As experienced software writers know, it is hard 
to predict from first principles how a class will eventually be 
reused, so it is common to expose more features of a class than 
necessary to avoid changing its definition once in use. If you 
are not extremely careful, this approach increases the 
dependencies on the initial implementation and makes the whole 
system more brittle.<P>

Modula-3 lets you control reuse with a degree of flexibility 
uncommon in strongly typed languages. The key concept is that an 
object type may be divided up into partial types, each of which 
describes some aspect of the object. A source file may then 
import, or reveal, only those aspects of an object relevant to 
the task at hand. Thus, the parts of a system that depend on a 
particular object feature can be isolated and found automatically 
when a change is necessary.<P>

In this article, I'll show how Modula-3's type system, with its
partial revelations, makes code reuse and encapsulation easier
compared to the statically typed, object-oriented languages. I'll then
work through an example showing the Modula-3 type system in use.<P>

<H3>So What's the Problem?</H3>
<P>
Statically typed, object-oriented languages generally support 
encapsulation by distinguishing between public and private 
features in a type, although there may also be intermediate 
states. There is a hierarchy of access in which privileged code 
can see the whole structure of an object but external code can 
only see the public features; see Figure 1.<P>

<IMG SRC="Figure1.gif" ALT="[ Image for Figure 1 ]"><BR>
<I><B>Figure 1:</B> Access Control in C++.<BR>
Access to each level of privacy includes<BR>
access to all the less private levels.</I><P>

The problem with this approach is that it treats all users 
of each level in the class the same way, and all-purpose code is 
always difficult to write. The class designer must draw a fine 
line in the class definition between exposing too little to be 
useful and exposing too much to be safe. Even escape mechanisms 
(such as the friend construct in C++) included in the visible 
definition are liable to acquire dependencies. Once a design is 
achieved, its details are embedded in every piece of code that 
uses the type, so a change in a high-level class must be 
propagated throughout a system; if the class is part of, say, a 
commercial library, then users just have to live with the 
designer's decisions. Class internals may not need to be accessed 
frequently, but when they are, it is likely to be important, and 
such prohibitions are doubly frustrating if the required features 
are visible, but inaccessible, in the class definition.<P>

<H3>An Associations Example</H3>

<P>
I'll illustrate my point using the "many-to-one associations" example
in Object-Oriented Modelling and Design, by James Rumbaugh et al.
(Prentice-Hall, 1991), which shows two classes: <TT>Item</TT> and
<TT>Group</TT>. When an <TT>Item</TT> is added to a <TT>Group</TT>,
the <TT>Group</TT> object is updated to include the new <TT>Item</TT>
and the <TT>Item</TT> object is updated so that it refers to the
<TT>Group</TT>. The cross-reference attributes in both classes,
however, should be accessible only to the code that maintains the
association. If the attributes were freely available, they could be
updated separately, thus allowing inconsistencies.<P>

Most statically typed languages have some mechanism for limited
relaxation of encapsulation. C++ has the <TT>friend</TT> construct,
whereby a class gives other classes or procedures access to its
private fields. <A HREF="#Listing1A">Listing One (a)</A> allows the
<TT>Group</TT>'s add and remove methods to update both sides of the
association together when links are added or removed, as in <A
HREF="#Listing1B">Listing One (b)</A>.<P>

<B><A NAME="Listing1A">Listing One (a)</A></B><P>

<PRE>
class Item {
  public:
    Group* MemberOf() const {return group_; };
  private:
    Group* group_;
    friend void Group::AddItem(Item*);    // allows methods to access 
    friend void Group::RemoveItem(Item*); // the group_ field
};

class Group {
  public:
    void           AddItem(Item* item);
    void           RemoveItem(Item* item);
    const ItemSet&amp; Items() const {return itemSet_; };
  private:
    ItemSet itemSet_; // a collection class to hold a set of items
};
</PRE>

<P><B><A NAME="Listing1B">Listing One (b)</A></B><P>

<PRE>
void Group::AddItem(Item* item) {
    item->group_ = this;
    itemSet_.Add(item);
}
</PRE>

<P>The disadvantage of this approach is that the details of the
implementation, although protected from inconsistent access, are
specified in the class definition. This increases the cost of changing
a class once it is in use and limits the range of possible extensions.
For example, to adapt the library for multithreading, it might be
necessary to add a mutex to the <TT>Item</TT> class that is locked
while the <TT>group_</TT> field is being set. Propagating a change in
a low-level class, such as <TT>Item</TT>, can require rebuilding large
amounts of code. Similarly, if you want to extend the <TT>Group</TT>
class so that, for example, changes in membership are logged, the
original author must have declared the add and remove methods as
<TT>virtual</TT> (that is, eligible to be overwritten in a subclass).
This approach constantly requires class designers to decide whether to
make a method virtual (and so more flexible) or not (and so more
efficient) before the class has been put to use.<P>

To defer such decisions, it's common to define an abstract type (which
includes methods but no data fields) that describes what you can do
with it, not how it is implemented; see
<A HREF="#Listing2A">Listing Two (a)</A>. You then write a
concrete subclass that has data fields (that is, state) and implements
the methods defined in the parent abstract type, as in
<A HREF="#Listing2B">Listing Two (b)</A>. It's also common to
provide a function that you call to create new instances of the
object. Users see objects of the abstract parent type, but these are
actually implemented by objects of the concrete child.<P>

<B><A NAME="Listing2A">Listing Two (a)</A></B><P>

<PRE>
class AbstractItem {
  public:
    virtual AbstractGroup* MemberOf() const = 0;
};
AbstractItem* CreateItem();
class AbstractGroup {
  public:
    virtual void           AddItem(AbstractItem* item) = 0;
    virtual void           RemoveItem(AbstractItem* item) = 0;
    virtual const ItemSet&amp; Items() const = 0;
};
AbstractGroup* CreateGroup(...);
</PRE>

<P><B><A NAME="Listing2B">Listing Two (b)</A></B><P>

<PRE>
class ConcreteItem: public AbstractItem {
  public:
    AbstractGroup* MemberOf() const {return group_; };
  private:
    AbstractGroup* group_;
    friend void ConcreteGroup::AddItem(AbstractItem*);
    friend void ConcreteGroup::RemoveItem(AbstractItem*);
};
AbstractItem* CreateItem() {
    return (AbstractItem*)new ConcreteItem;
};
</PRE>

<P>This isolates the users of a class from its implementation, but makes
reuse by inheritance difficult, as a subclass of the public
<TT>AbstractItem</TT> will not inherit from the private
<TT>ConcreteItem</TT>. Class designers may also use delegation, in
which the <TT>Item</TT> behavior is managed by an abstract object in
the public class to which the method calls are forwarded; see <A
HREF="#Listing2C">Listing Two (c)</A>.<P>

<B><A NAME="Listing2C">Listing Two (c)</A></B><P>

<PRE>
class Item: public AbstractItem {
  public:
    Item() { impl_ = CreateItem(); };
    ~Item() { delete impl_; };
    Group* MemberOf() const { return impl_->MemberOf(); };
    AbstractItem* Implementation() const { return impl_; };
  private:
    AbstractItem* impl_;
};
</PRE>

<P>In addition, methods such as <TT>AddItem</TT> in the (public) 
abstract classes must be defined in terms of other abstract 
classes because the (private) concrete classes are invisible at 
this level. This means that the implementations of these methods 
must receive parameters as abstract types and cast them down to 
their concrete subclass, which either requires an extra 
consistency check or provides a potential source of pointer 
errors.<P>

Other languages are more flexible. Eiffel, for example, provides a
<TT>redefine</TT> keyword that allows a subclass to override any of
its ancestor's public methods--unlike C++, in which the ancestor class
must declare the methods that may be overridden. Eiffel, however, also
requires the ancestor class to declare which other classes can access
its private fields, so our <TT>Item</TT> class is defined as
<A HREF="#Listing3">Listing Three</A>. Again, specifying exported
features in the class definition makes it more difficult to
restructure an installed library or program. Furthermore, the controls
can be overridden by defining a new subclass of <TT>GROUP</TT> to gain
arbitrary access to the <TT>ITEM</TT> internals.<P>

<B><A NAME="Listing3">Listing Three</A></B><P>

<PRE>
class ITEM
  export
    member_of                            -- this method available to everyone
    set_group{GROUP}, clear_group{GROUP} -- methods available to class GROUP
  feature
    mygroup: GROUP;
    member_of: GROUP is do Result := mygroup end;
    set_group(g: GROUP) is do mygroup := g end;
    clear_group is forget(mygroup) end;
end -- ITEM
</PRE>

<P>Ada 95 also distinguishes between public and private features of a
type and uses its support for structured libraries to control access.
Briefly, an Ada program unit (or package) has a specification, divided
into visible and private sections, and a body. The logical interface
to a package, its abstract types and procedure declarations, is
defined in the visible section of the specification; this is what
clients of the package use. The implementation of a package is split
between the private section of the specification, which expands the
definitions of the data types, and the package body, which contains
the procedure code; the private section is accessible from the body,
but not from clients of the package. An Ada 95 specification of the
example might look like <A HREF="#Listing4">Listing Four</A>.<P>

<B><A NAME="Listing4">Listing Four</A></B><P>

<PRE>
with Items; use Items;
package Association is
    -- visible section
    type Item is private;
    type Item_ptr  is access all Item'Class;
    type Group is private;
    type Group_ptr is access all Group'Class;
    procedure AddItem(G: Group_ptr; I Item_ptr);
    procedure RemoveItem(G: Group_ptr; I Item_ptr);
    function Items(G: in Group'Class) return Items.List;
  private
    -- private to implementation
    type Item is tagged record
        group: Group_ptr;
    end record;
    type Group is tagged record
        Items : Items.Set;
    end record;
end Association;
</PRE>

<P>Ada 95 supports hierarchies of packages. That is, given a package
<TT>parent</TT>, you can write a package <TT>parent.child</TT> to
extend it; the visible specification of the new package will inherit
the visible features of the parent. More importantly, the (private)
implementation of a child can see all the private features of its
ancestors, whereas the public interface to a child sees only the
ancestors' visible sections. The Ada 95 approach is a little like a
street of theaters: The public sees only what's on stage, while some
of the backstage crew have access to everything in the building. Each
theater (or library), however, is independent; the crew of one theater
is not allowed backstage next door, but can still buy tickets to see
the show. This approach supports the way software libraries are built
(or should be), but suffers from two limitations: first, the concrete
part of a data type is still held in the interface file, so it may be
difficult to predict what will need to be rebuilt when an
implementation changes; second, the package designer must still decide
exactly how it may be reused before it is put into service, so changes
to an installed library may be painful.<P>

While it is possible to separate interface and implementation in most
statically typed OO languages, engineering such a design for long-term
reuse requires skill and experience because too many details must be
committed to too early. In Modula-3, programmers do not have to put
all the details of a class in a single place, yet the benefits of a
strong type system are retained. There are two main techniques:<P>

<UL>
<LI> Classes can be subclassed when not all of the parent class is 
visible, so the private features of a class really are private, 
not just inaccessible.
<LI> Class definitions can be divided across multiple files, so a 
program unit imports only the relevant aspects of a class; this 
allows fine-grain control over the visibility of the parts of an 
object. 
</UL>

<H3>Modula-3 Basics</H3>

<P>
Modula-3 is a statically typed, object-oriented language with single
inheritance, integrated threads, garbage collection and exception
handling, and separate interface and implementation files. To
illustrate basic Modula-3 concepts, I'll first rewrite the
Associations example in <A HREF="#Listing2A">Listing Two</A>. <A
HREF="#Listing5">Listing Five</A> is the interface file
<TT>Association.i3</TT> (interface files define a namespace that can
contain type definitions and procedure and variable declarations, but
no implementation code). The <TT>IMPORT</TT> statement makes the
contents of another interface file available; here, I import the type
<TT>T</TT> from the interface <TT>List</TT> to define the value
returned from the <TT>items</TT> method of the <TT>Group</TT> object.
Modula-3 objects are records that may contain variables and methods;
here, of course, the abstract types have no variable fields because
these are only defined in the implementation.<P>

    removeItem(item: Item);
    items(): List.T;
  END;

END Association.
</PRE>

<P>The phrase "<TT>type1 &lt;: type2</TT>" is an example of partial
revelation. It says that <TT>type1</TT> is a subtype of <TT>type2</TT>
but that this is not the entire definition of type1; the rest will be
revealed in other places, possibly in other files. The
<TT>Association</TT> interface, for example, defines an <TT>Item</TT>
as a subtype of an <TT>AbstractItem</TT>, so it includes a
<TT>memberOf</TT> method, but provides no other information about its
features. The <TT>AbstractItem</TT> and <TT>AbstractGroup</TT> names
are not strictly necessary, but are introduced to save retyping the
object details in the implementation file <TT>Association.m3</TT>, as
in <A HREF="#Listing6">Listing Six</A>.<P>

<B><A NAME="Listing6">Listing Six</A></B><P>

    BEGIN RETURN self.itemSet.makeList(); END;

BEGIN (* empty module initialization block *)
END Association.
</PRE>

<P>The phrase "<TT>REVEAL type1=type2</TT>" provides more information about
the structure of <TT>type1</TT>. The use of "<TT>=</TT>" shows that
this is the final revelation in the declaration of an object type;
there can be multiple partial revelations about the structure of an
object. In this case, an <TT>Item</TT> object contains a group data
field, and the <TT>memberOf</TT> method has been overridden by the
procedure <TT>ItemMemberOf</TT>; in other words, I provide a concrete
implementation. The implementation is entirely hidden from the rest of
the library (it could be replaced by relinking the application with a
new implementation module), but you can still meaningfully subclass
from the <TT>Item</TT> and <TT>Group</TT> types in the
<TT>Association</TT> interface. For example, to add logging to the add
method of <TT>Group</TT>, write the subclass in
<A HREF="#Listing7">Listing Seven</A>.<P> 

<B><A NAME="Listing7">Listing Seven</A></B><P>

<PRE>
IMPORT Association;

TYPE
  LogGroup = Association.Group OBJECT OVERRIDES
    addItem := LogGroupAddItem;
  END;

PROCEDURE LogGroupAddItem(self: LogGroup; item: Assocation.Item) =
  BEGIN
    (* log the addition, then directly call the parent method *)
    LogAddition(self, item);
    Association.Group.addItem(self, item);
  END;
</PRE>

<P>With the addition of our new logging feature, the new 
<TT>LogGroup</TT> object inherits all the hidden behavior of the 
<TT>Association.Group</TT> object. This demonstrates subtyping the parent 
type when not all is visible. The implementation of 
<TT>Assocation.Group</TT> is entirely hidden behind its interface, so 
program units that use the public type do not depend on its 
private implementation. To subtype in this way in C++ or Eiffel, 
for example, you would either have to write a concrete class that 
exposes some implementation details or write a delegation class 
that includes an abstract object to which method calls are 
forwarded.<P>

<H3>Partitioning an Object Definition</H3>
<P>
Class designers use partial revelation to split the definition of 
an object type across multiple files, both interface and 
implementation. A revelation in an interface is a mechanism for 
access control; it makes some feature of an object accessible 
wherever the interface is imported. A revelation in an 
implementation, on the other hand, is a mechanism for 
encapsulation; it is an addition to the object definition that is 
visible only within that implementation.<P>

<H3>Beyond Simple Encapsulation: Associations Revisited</H3>
<P>
Partial revelation really shines when used to support 
sophisticated access control to the features of an object type. 
To demonstrate this, I'll present an unreasonable extension of 
the Association objects. We have a hypothetical new requirement 
that Associations work with multiple threads, so the objects must 
be protected against concurrent changes. We also want to allow a 
thread to be notified when another thread has added a new item to 
a group. This new requirement, however, says nothing about the 
implementation of associations, so we can divide our new objects 
into three aspects: The first deals with the data structures for 
associating items and groups, the second deals with 
multithreading issues and handles locking and notification, and 
the third deals with class-wide code that is independent of 
either of these specific issues. These aspects are independent of 
each other, so a change of data structure need not affect the 
locking scheme, and we can partition our object types to reflect 
this.<P>

The first interface (see <A HREF="#Listing8">Listing Eight</A>)
provides opaque types; it reveals only that the objects have
identifiable types and the operations the objects respond to. This
interface is for normal clients who just want to use the types without
knowing about their implementation. Next, I define abstract types for
the item and group objects; any implementation must provide code for
the methods of the object types in <A HREF="#Listing9">Listing
Nine</A>. This interface is similar to the original version in <A
HREF="#Listing5">Listing Five</A>, except that it now includes the
opaque types <TT>ItemPrivate</TT> and <TT>GroupPrivate</TT>; I'll
explain the purpose of these types shortly. Once the library is
installed, however, I might want to write the logging subtype from <A
HREF="#Listing7">Listing Seven</A>; I can do this with the
interfaces provided so far. If I import <TT>AssocClass</TT>, I know
that any group object includes an addItem method that I can override.
I can subclass knowing very little about the how the types are
implemented and pass the new type to the procedures in Association.
Note that, so far, the multithreading features of the objects are
completely invisible.<P>

<P>The next stage is to provide an implementation of items and groups, so
I write an interface AssocImpl as a default version; see <A
HREF="#Listing10A">Listing Ten (a)</A>. The subtypes declared
here are still opaque, so a client knows only that they can be used
with the procedures declared in Associations. The module
<TT>AssocImpl.m3</TT> in <A HREF="#Listing10B">Listing Ten
(b)</A> reveals more detail about these types--we are not defining a
further level of subtyping here, but adding more detail to an existing
type. This module reveals that the items are stored using a standard
<TT>Set.T</TT> type and provides implementations for the methods for
the <TT>Item</TT> and <TT>Group</TT> objects. For example, the
<TT>AddItem</TT> procedure in <A HREF="#Listing10C">Listing
Ten (c)</A> ensures that the <TT>Set</TT> field of the <TT>Group</TT>
object has been initialized and adds the new item to it. I don't need
to call the <TT>setGroup</TT> method of the item because, as you'll see below,
this will be done elsewhere.<P>

<H3>Exposing Unsafe Features</H3>
<P>
More-sophisticated clients know that each call of a procedure in the
<TT>Association</TT> interface involves acquiring and freeing a lock,
which may be expensive. If they had access to an appropriate level of
detail, they could batch a set of calls within a single lock, rather
than locking each time; thus, the code in <A
HREF="#Listing11A">Listing Eleven (a)</A> might change to
that in <A HREF="#Listing11B">Listing Eleven (b)</A>. There's
also an explicit call to notify any other waiting threads that new
items have arrived, as this is also normally provided by
<TT>Association.AddItem</TT>. Clearly, programmers working at this
level must be more careful because they can no longer rely on the
implementation to ensure, for example, that a group is locked before
an item is added to it.<P>

<P>
Modula-3 distinguishes between safe and unsafe program units; unsafe
interfaces and modules allow the programmer more freedom but provide
fewer guarantees that errors will be caught by compiler analysis of
the code. An unsafe interface may only be imported by unsafe modules
and other unsafe interfaces, but an unsafe module may implement a safe
interface--which is how Modula-3 provides safe access to external (and
so uncheckable) libraries. Modula-3 supports this controlled
relaxation of its type safety to help programmers isolate and identify
code that is "dangerous."<P>

I have made the interface <TT>UnsafeAssoc</TT> unsafe because it
allows a programmer to bypass the thread-safe code provided through
the <TT>Association</TT> interface; this code is shown in <A
HREF="#Listing12">Listing Twelve</A>. <TT>UnsafeAssoc</TT> reveals
that both the item and group object types are derived from
<TT>MUTEX</TT>, a built-in mutual exclusion type, so any code that
imports this interface can lock item or group objects, as in <A
HREF="#Listing11B">Listing Eleven (b)</A>. The interface also
declares unsafe versions of the thread-safe procedures that implement
class-wide behavior. We know that these procedures are not concerned
with thread safety because item and group locking is done separately.
Data-structure management is defined in the <TT>AssocImpl</TT> module,
so the unsafe procedures have common behavior across all
implementations of Associations. I also use this interface to declare
a procedure that supports the notification of the arrival of new
items.<P>

</PRE>

<P>Now I can write the module <TT>Assocation.m3</TT>, which provides the
final revelations about the item and group types and implements the
procedures declared in <TT>Association</TT> and <TT>UnsafeAssoc</TT>.
<A HREF="#Listing13A">Listing Thirteen (a)</A> shows the
start of the module; the <TT>EXPORTS</TT> clause says that this module
implements, and automatically imports, those interfaces. Note that
<TT>Association</TT> and <TT>AssocClass</TT> are safe, whereas
<TT>UnsafeAssoc</TT> is not. The final revelations for the item and
group object types show that there is nothing more to say about item
objects, but that groups need some extra state that will be used for
the thread-specific code. <A HREF="#Listing13B">Listing
Thirteen (b)</A> shows the implementation of two procedures from the
<TT>UnsafeAssoc</TT> interface. <TT>NotifyNewItem</TT> simply sets the
last item variable and wakes up all the threads waiting on the group's
condition variable, while <TT>UnsafeAddItem</TT> adds the item to the
group and sets the group in the item. Finally, <A
HREF="#Listing13C">Listing Thirteen (c)</A> shows the code
for two of the procedures in the <TT>Association</TT> interface; this
is where all the code associated with thread safety belongs.
<TT>AddItem</TT> provides a safe wrapper for the
<TT>UnsafeAddItem</TT> call, and <TT>NewItem</TT> blocks its calling
thread until a new item has been added to the group.<P>

<P>The <TT>Association</TT> example, although contrived, shows how 
partial revelation can be used to partition an object type by 
feature, rather than by the designer's conception of how it will 
be used. Clients of the library can import just those features 
they need, perhaps to reimplement the default implementation or 
to optimize a set of calls. In this case, the object types were 
divided into concerns about data structures, thread-safety, and 
class-wide behavior. I can change each of these independently, 
and Modula-3's import system makes dependencies on existing code 
easy to find.<P>

<H3>Summary</H3>
<P>
Partial revelation is a powerful technique for providing 
controlled access to the features of an object type. A class 
definition can be split into a set of distinct features made 
accessible by importing interfaces. There is no hierarchy of 
access imposed at the interface level, so each feature can be 
imported independently into a program unit; see Figure 2. The 
definitive structure of the type is then finally revealed in the 
implementation.<P>

<IMG SRC="Figure2.gif" ALT="[ Image for Figure 2 ]"><BR>
<I><B>Figure 2:</B> The Group type hierarchy<BR>
as defined in the interfaces; subtypes<BR>
are shown above their parent types.</I><P>

The division of an object type can be based on its essential 
features, rather than on the designer's expectations about its 
use and implementation concerns. Furthermore, importing the 
interface localizes the dependence on features of the supertype 
and makes such dependencies easy to find automatically. When an 
interface is intended for use within a library's implementation 
but not by its clients, privacy can be achieved by controlling 
access to the interface file.<P>

Modula-3 reduces the tension between reuse and encapsulation 
by allowing programmers to avoid embedding implementation details 
in the visible definition of a class. A designer can concentrate 
on extracting the essential features of a class, rather than 
declaring in advance how it relates to other classes and 
procedures. Users of a class can select only those features they 
need and still reuse them by inheritance; the hidden parts of the 
class are still available and can be revealed elsewhere in the 
program. Partial revelation avoids the rigidity of a hierarchical 
access system and provides inheritance with true encapsulation, 
as opposed to simple access control, without the implementation 
costs and risks of delegation.<P>

The ability to import only the necessary features of a class 
means that dependencies are limited to the code that uses them 
and are made explicit when they occur. This reduces code 
fragility and makes it easier to develop software-management 
tools. Furthermore, Modula-3's distinction between safe and 
unsafe program units highlights vulnerable code and provides 
language support for multiple roles in a software team.<P>

Of course, writing reusable objects is still hard and no language can
be a substitute for good ideas, but the right language can assist in
the their design and implementation. The many libraries available with
the Modula-3 distribution provide both models for how to write
well-structured software and a mine of reliable code for reuse.
There's an excellent discussion of how this technique was used for the
Modula-3 I/O library in Systems Programming with Modula-3, edited by
Greg Nelson (Prentice-Hall, 1991). "Adding Digital Video to an
Object-Oriented User Interface Toolkit," by Mark Manasse and myself
(Object-Oriented Programming, ECOOP 1994, Springer-Verlag, 1994),
describes how the type system helped during a major modification of
Trestle, the Modula-3 user interface toolkit. Modula-3 is freely
available for a wide range of platforms. Its home page is at <A
HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/modula-3/html/home.html"><TT>http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/modula-3/html/home.html</TT></A>
and is available via anonymous ftp from <A
HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Modula-3/"><TT>gatekeeper.dec.com</TT></A>.
There is also a newsgroup <A
HREF="news:comp.lang.modula3"><TT>comp.lang.modula3</TT></A>.<P>

Modula-3's partial revelation, especially when combined with its
interface and module structure, provides a powerful and unusual tool
for managing the trade-off between reuse and encapsulation. It doesn't
impose the hierarchical approach to encapsulation of other statically
typed object-oriented languages, so there's less need either to
subvert the type system, or to increase code dependencies to achieve
the flexibility that any substantial library or application needs.
It's an effective programming-language technology that deserves to be
better known and widely used.<P>
