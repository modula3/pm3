<P>

A character literal is a pair of single quotes enclosing either a
single ISO-Latin-1 printing character (excluding single quote)
or an escape sequence.  The type of a character literal is <TT>CHAR</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.172">A</A>
text literal is a pair of double quotes enclosing a sequence of
ISO-Latin-1 printing characters (excluding double quote) and escape
sequences.  The type of a text literal is <TT>TEXT</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.173">Here are</A>
are the legal escape sequences and the characters they denote:
<PRE>
    \n   newline (linefeed)     \f    form feed 
    \t   tab                    \\    backslash 
    \r   carriage return        \"    double quote 
    \'   single quote           \nnn  char with code <TT>8_nnn</TT>
</PRE>
A <TT>\</TT> followed by exactly three octal digits specifies the character
whose code is that octal value.  A <TT>\</TT> that is not a part
of one of these escape sequences is a static error.
<P>

For example, <TT>'a'</TT> and <TT>'\''</TT> are valid character
literals, <TT>'''</TT> is not; <TT>""</TT> and <TT>"Don't\n"</TT>
are valid text literals, <TT>"""</TT> is not.
<P>
