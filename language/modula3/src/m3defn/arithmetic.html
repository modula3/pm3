<H2>Arithmetic operations</H2>
<P>

The basic arithmetic operations are built into the language;
additional operations are provided by the required
<A HREF="intfs.html">floating-point interfaces</A>.
<P>

To test or set the implementation's behavior for overflow, underflow,
rounding, and division by zero, see the required interface
<A HREF="floatmode.html"><TT>FloatMode</TT></A>.
Modula-3 arithmetic was designed
to support the
<A HREF="../../../../intro/src/bib.html#m3fp">IEEE floating-point</A>
standard, but not to require it.
<P>

To perform arithmetic operations modulo the word size, programs should
use the routines in the required interface
<A HREF="word-intf.html"><TT>Word</TT></A>.
<P>

Implementations must not rearrange the computation of expressions in
a way that could affect the result.  For example, <TT>(x+y)+z</TT>
generally cannot be computed as <TT>x+(y+z)</TT>, since addition is not
associative either for bounded integers or for floating-point values.
<P>

<P>
As a prefix operator, <TT>+x</TT> returns <TT>x</TT>.  
As an infix operator on numeric arguments,
<TT>+</TT> denotes addition. On sets, <TT>+</TT> denotes set union.
That is,
<TT>e IN (x + y)</TT> if and only if <TT>(e IN x) OR (e IN y)</TT>.
The types of <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> must be the same, and the result 
is the same type as both. 
In unsafe modules, <TT>+</TT> is extended to <TT>ADDRESS</TT>.

<P>
As a prefix operator, <TT>-x</TT> is the negative of <TT>x</TT>. 
As an infix operator on numeric arguments, <TT>-</TT> denotes subtraction.
On sets, <TT>-</TT> denotes set difference.
That is, <TT>e IN (x - y)</TT> if and only if

The types of <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> must be the same, and the result

</PRE>
<P>The value <TT>x DIV y</TT> is the floor of 
the quotient of <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT>; that is, the maximum integer 
not exceeding the real number <TT>z</TT> such that <TT>z * y = x</TT>.
For integers <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT>, the value of <TT>x MOD y</TT> is

<P>

This means that for positive <TT>y</TT>, the value of <TT>x MOD y</TT>
lies in the interval <TT>[0 .. y-1]</TT>, regardless of 
the sign of <TT>x</TT>.  For negative <TT>y</TT>, the value of
<TT>x MOD y</TT> lies in the interval <TT>[y+1 .. 0]</TT>, regardless 
of the sign of <TT>x</TT>.
<P>

If <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> are floats, the value of <TT>x MOD y</TT> is 
<TT>x - y * FLOOR(x / y)</TT>.  This may be computed as a Modula-3
expression, or by a method that avoids overflow if <TT>x</TT> is much
greater than <TT>y</TT>.  The types of <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> must
be the same, and the result is the same type as both.

The type <TT>T</TT> must be a floating-point type;
