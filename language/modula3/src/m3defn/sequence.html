<H1>Sequential composition </H1>
<P>

A statement of the form:
<PRE>
    S_1; S_2
</PRE>
<P>executes <TT>S_1</TT>, and then if the outcome is normal, executes
<TT>S_2</TT>.  If the outcome of <TT>S_1</TT> is an exception, <TT>S_2</TT>
is ignored.
<P>

Some programmers use the semicolon as a statement
terminator, some as a statement separator.  Similarly, some
use the vertical bar in case statements as a case initiator, some
as a separator.  Modula-3 allows both styles.  This report
uses both operators as separators.
