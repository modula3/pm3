     infix    =, #  (x, y: Any): BOOLEAN
</PRE>
<P>The operator <TT>=</TT> returns <TT>TRUE</TT> if <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> 
are equal.  The operator <TT>#</TT> returns <TT>TRUE</TT> 
if <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> are not equal.
It is a static error if the type of <TT>x</TT> is not
assignable to the type of <TT>y</TT> or vice versa.
<P>

Ordinals are equal if they have the same value.  Floats are equal
if the underlying implementation defines them to be; for example,
on an IEEE implementation, <TT>+0</TT> equals <TT>-0</TT> and
<TT>NaN</TT> does not equal itself.
References are equal if they address the same location.
Procedures are equal if they agree as closures; that
is, if they refer to the same procedure body and environment.
Sets are equal if they have the same elements.
Arrays are equal if they have the same length and corresponding
elements are equal.
Records are equal if they have the same fields and corresponding fields
are equal.
<P>

     infix    &lt;=, &gt;=  (x,y: Ordinal) : BOOLEAN
                      (x,y: Float)   : BOOLEAN
                      (x,y: ADDRESS) : BOOLEAN
                      (x,y: Set)     : BOOLEAN
</PRE>
<P>In the first three cases, <TT>&lt;=</TT> returns <TT>TRUE</TT> if <TT>x</TT> 
is at most as large as <TT>y</TT>.  In the last case, <TT>&lt;=</TT> returns 
<TT>TRUE</TT> if every element of <TT>x</TT> is an element of <TT>y</TT>.  
In all cases, it is a static error if the type of <TT>x</TT> is 
not assignable to the type of <TT>y</TT>, or vice versa.
The expression <TT>x &gt;= y</TT> is equivalent to <TT>y &lt;= x</TT>.

     infix    &gt;, &lt;    (x,y: Ordinal) : BOOLEAN
                      (x,y: Float)   : BOOLEAN
                      (x,y: ADDRESS) : BOOLEAN
                      (x,y: Set)     : BOOLEAN
</PRE>
<P>In all cases, <TT>x &lt; y</TT> means <TT>(x &lt;= y) AND (x # y)</TT>,
and <TT>x &gt; y</TT> means <TT>y &lt; x</TT>.
It is a static error if the type of <TT>x</TT> is not assignable
to the type of <TT>y</TT>, or vice versa.
<P>

Warning: with IEEE floating-point, <TT>x &lt;= y</TT>
is not the same as <TT>NOT x &gt; y</TT>.
<P>

<PRE ID="idx.195">
     infix    IN (e: Ordinal; s: Set): BOOLEAN
</PRE>
<P>Returns <TT>TRUE</TT> if <TT>e</TT> is an element of the set <TT>s</TT>.
It is a static error if the type of <TT>e</TT> is not assignable to
the element type of <TT>s</TT>.
If the value of <TT>e</TT> is not a member of the element type,
no error occurs, but <TT>IN</TT> returns <TT>FALSE</TT>.
