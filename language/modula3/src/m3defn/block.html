<P>

A block statement has the form:
<PRE>
    Decls BEGIN S END
</PRE>
where <TT>Decls</TT> is a sequence of declarations and <TT>S</TT>
is a statement.
The block introduces the constants, types, variables, 
and procedures declared in <TT>Decls</TT> and then executes <TT>S</TT>.
The scope of the
<A HREF="decls.html">declared names</A>
is the block.
