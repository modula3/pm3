<P>

Constant expressions are a subset of the general class of expressions,
restricted by the requirement that it be possible to evaluate the
expression statically.  All operations are legal in constant expressions
except for <TT>ADR</TT>, <TT>LOOPHOLE</TT>, <TT>TYPECODE</TT>, <TT>NARROW</TT>,
<TT>ISTYPE</TT>, <TT>SUBARRAY</TT>, <TT>NEW</TT>, dereferencing (explicit or
implicit), and the only procedures that can be applied are the functions
in the
<A HREF="word-intf.html"><TT>Word</TT></A> interface.
<P>

A variable can appear in a constant expression only as an argument
to <TT>FIRST</TT>, <TT>LAST</TT>, <TT>NUMBER</TT>, <TT>BITSIZE</TT>,
<TT>BYTESIZE</TT>, or <TT>ADRSIZE</TT>, and such a variable must not
have an open array type.
Literals and top-level procedure constants are legal in constant
expressions.
<P>
