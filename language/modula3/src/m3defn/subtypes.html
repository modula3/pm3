<H1>Subtyping rules</H1>
<P>

We write <TT>T &lt;: U</TT> to indicate that <TT>T</TT> is a subtype
of <TT>U</TT> and <TT>U</TT> is a supertype of <TT>T</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.70>If</A>
<TT>T &lt;: U</TT>, then every value of type <TT>T</TT> is also a value 
of type <TT>U</TT>.  The converse does not hold:  for example, a record 
or array type with packed fields contains the same values as the 
corresponding type with unpacked fields, but there is no subtype 
relation between them.  This section presents the rules that define 
the subtyping relation.
<P>

For ordinal types <TT>T</TT> and <TT>U</TT>, we have <TT>T &lt;:
U</TT> if they have the same basetype and every member of <TT>T</TT>
is a member of <TT>U</TT>. That is, subtyping on ordinal types
reflects the subset relation on the value sets.  
<P>

<A NAME=idx.71>For array types,</A>
<PRE>
       (ARRAY OF)^m  ARRAY J_1 OF ... ARRAY J_n OF
          ARRAY K_1 OF ... ARRAY K_p OF T
    &lt;: (ARRAY OF)^m  (ARRAY OF)^n
          ARRAY I_1 OF ... ARRAY I_p OF T

    if NUMBER(I_i) = NUMBER(K_i)  for i = 1, ..., p.
</PRE>
<P>

That is, an array type <TT>A</TT> is a subtype of an array type
<TT>B</TT> if they have the same ultimate element type, the same 
number of dimensions, and, for each dimension, either both are open
(as in the first m dimensions above),
or <TT>A</TT> is fixed and <TT>B</TT> is open
(as in the next n dimensions above), or they are 
both fixed and have the same size
(as in the last p dimensions above).
<P>

<PRE ID="idx.72">
   NULL &lt;: REF T &lt;: REFANY
   NULL &lt;: UNTRACED REF T &lt;: ADDRESS
</PRE>
<P>

That is, <TT>REFANY</TT> and <TT>ADDRESS</TT> contain all traced and
untraced references, respectively, and <TT>NIL</TT> is a member
of every reference type. These rules also apply to branded
types.
<P>

<PRE ID="idx.73">
    NULL &lt;: PROCEDURE(A): R RAISES S   for any A, R, and S.
</PRE>
<P>That is, <TT>NIL</TT> is a member of every procedure type.  

<PRE>
    PROCEDURE(A): Q RAISES E  &lt;:  PROCEDURE(B): R RAISES F
    if signature "(B): R RAISES F" covers signature "(A): Q RAISES E".
</PRE>
<P>That is, for procedure types, <TT>T &lt;: U</TT> if 
they are the same except for parameter names, defaults, 
and raises sets, and the raises set for <TT>T</TT> is contained in the 
raises set for <TT>U</TT>.
<P>

<PRE ID="idx.74">
    ROOT &lt;: REFANY
    UNTRACED ROOT &lt;: ADDRESS
    NULL &lt;: T OBJECT ... END &lt;: T
</PRE>
<P>That is, every object is a reference,
<TT>NIL</TT> is a member of every 
object type, and every subtype is included in its supertype. 
The third rule also applies to branded types.

<PRE ID="idx.75">
    BITS n FOR T &lt;: T   and  T &lt;: BITS n FOR T
</PRE>
<P>That is, <TT>BITS FOR T</TT> has the same values as <TT>T</TT>.

<PRE>
    T &lt;: T  for all T
    T &lt;: U  and   U &lt;: V  implies  T &lt;: V  for all T, U, V.
</PRE>
<P>That is, <TT>&lt;:</TT> is reflexive and transitive. 
<P>

Note that <TT>T &lt;: U</TT> and <TT>U &lt;: T</TT> does not imply that
<TT>T</TT> and <TT>U</TT> are the same, since the subtype relation
is unaffected by parameter names, default values, and packing.
<P>

For example, consider:
<PRE>
    TYPE 
      T = [0..255];
      U = BITS 8 FOR [0..255];
      AT = ARRAY OF T;
      AU = ARRAY OF U;
</PRE>
<P>The types <TT>T</TT> and <TT>U</TT> are subtypes of one another but are 
not the same. The types <TT>AT</TT> and <TT>AU</TT> are 
unrelated by the subtype relation.
