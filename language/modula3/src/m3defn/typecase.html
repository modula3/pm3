<H2>Typecase</H2>
<P>

A <TT>TYPECASE</TT> statement has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPECASE Expr OF
      T_1 (v_1) => S_1
    | ...
    | T_n (v_n) => S_n
    ELSE S_0
    END
</PRE>
where <TT>Expr</TT> is an expression whose type is a reference type, 
the <TT>S</TT>'s are statements, the <TT>T</TT>'s are reference types, 
and the <TT>v</TT>'s are identifiers.  It is a static error if <TT>
Expr</TT> has type <TT>ADDRESS</TT> or if any <TT>T</TT> is not a subtype of 
the type of <TT>Expr</TT>.  The "<TT>ELSE S_0</TT>" 
and each "<TT>(v)</TT>" are optional.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.116>The</A>
statement evaluates <TT>Expr</TT>.  If the resulting reference value
is a member of any listed type <TT>T_i</TT>, then <TT>S_i</TT> is executed,
for the minimum such i.  (Thus a <TT>NULL</TT> case is useful only if it
comes first.)  If the value is a member of no listed type and
"<TT>ELSE S_0</TT>" is present, then it is executed.  If the value is a member
of no listed type and "<TT>ELSE S_0</TT>" is absent, a checked runtime error
occurs.
<P>

Each <TT>(v_i)</TT> declares a variable whose type is <TT>T_i</TT> and
whose scope is <TT>S_i</TT>.  If <TT>v_i</TT> is present, it is
initialized to the value of <TT>Expr</TT> before <TT>S_i</TT> is
executed.
<P>

If <TT>(v_i)</TT> is absent, then <TT>T_i</TT> can be a list of type
expressions separated by commas, as shorthand for a list in
which the rest of the branch is repeated for each type expression.
That is:
<PRE>
    T_1, ..., T_n => S
</PRE>
is shorthand for:
<PRE>
    T_1 => S | ... | T_n => S
</PRE>	
<P>

For example:
<PRE>
    PROCEDURE ToText(r: REFANY): TEXT =
      (* Assume r = NIL or r^ is a BOOLEAN or INTEGER. *)
      BEGIN
        TYPECASE r OF
          NULL => RETURN "NIL"
        | REF BOOLEAN (rb) => RETURN Fmt.Bool(rb^)
        | REF INTEGER (ri) => RETURN Fmt.Int(ri^)
        END
      END ToText;
</PRE>
<P>
