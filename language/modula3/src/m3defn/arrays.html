<H2>Array types</H2>
<P>

An <EM>array</EM> is an indexed collection of component variables,
called the <EM>elements</EM> of the array.  The indexes are the values of
an ordinal type, called the <EM>index type</EM> of the array.  The elements
all have the same size and the same type, called the <EM>element type</EM>
of the array.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.37>There</A>
are two kinds of array types, <EM>fixed</EM> and <EM>open</EM>.  The
length of a fixed array is determined at compile time.  The length
of an open array type is determined at runtime, when it is allocated
or bound.  The length cannot be changed thereafter.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.38>The</A>
<EM>shape</EM> of a multi-dimensional array is the sequence of its 
lengths in each dimension.  More precisely, the shape of an array 
is its length followed by the shape of any of its elements; the shape 
of a non-array is the empty sequence.  
<P>

<A NAME=idx.39>Arrays</A>
are assignable if they have the same element type and shape. 
If either the source or target of the assignment is an open array, 
a runtime shape check is required.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.40>A</A>
fixed array type declaration has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = ARRAY Index OF Element
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>Index</TT> is an ordinal type and <TT>Element</TT> is any type other
than an open array type.  The values of type <TT>T</TT> are arrays whose
element type is <TT>Element</TT> and whose length is the number of elements
of the type <TT>Index</TT>.  
<P>

<A NAME=idx.41>If</A>
<TT>a</TT> has type <TT>T</TT>, then <TT>a[i]</TT> designates the element 
of <TT>a</TT> whose position corresponds to the position of <TT>i</TT> 
in <TT>Index</TT>.  For example, consider the declarations:
<PRE>
    VAR a := ARRAY [1..3] OF REAL {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};
    VAR b: ARRAY [-1..1] OF REAL := a;
</PRE>
<P>Now <TT>a = b</TT> is <TT>TRUE</TT>;
yet <TT>a[1] = 1.0</TT> while <TT>b[1] = 3.0</TT>.
The interpretation of indexes is determined by an array's
type, not its value; the assignment <TT>b := a</TT> changes <TT>b</TT>'s
value, not its type.  (This example uses
<A HREF="variables.html">variable initialization</A>,
and
<A HREF="construct.html#176a">array constructors</A>.)
<P>

<A NAME=idx.42>An</A>
expression of the form:
<PRE>
    ARRAY Index_1, ..., Index_n OF Element
</PRE>
<P>is shorthand for:
<PRE>
    ARRAY Index_1 OF ... OF ARRAY Index_n OF Element
</PRE>
<P>

This shorthand is eliminated from the expanded type definition
used to define structural equivalence.  An expression of the form
<TT>a[i_1</TT>, <TT>...</TT>, <TT>i_n]</TT>
is shorthand for <TT>a[i_1]...[i_n]</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.43>An</A>
open array type declaration has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = ARRAY OF Element
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>Element</TT> is any type.  The values of <TT>T</TT> are arrays 
whose element type is <TT>Element</TT> and whose length is arbitrary.  
The index type of an open array is the integer subrange
<TT>[0..n-1]</TT>, where <TT>n</TT> is the length of the array.  
<P>

An open array type can be used only as the type of a formal parameter,
the referent of a reference type, the element type of another open
array type, or as the type in an array constructor.
<P>

Examples of array types:
<PRE>
    TYPE
       Transform = ARRAY [1..3], [1..3] OF REAL;
       Vector    = ARRAY OF REAL;
       SkipTable = ARRAY CHAR OF INTEGER
</PRE>
