<H2>Safety</H2>
<P>

The keyword <TT>UNSAFE</TT> can precede the declaration of any interface
or module to indicate that it is <EM>unsafe</EM>; that is, uses the
<A HREF="unsafe.html">unsafe features</A>
of the language.
An interface or module not explicitly labeled
<TT>UNSAFE</TT> is called <EM>safe</EM>.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.150>An</A>
interface is <EM>intrinsically safe</EM> if there is no way to produce
an unchecked runtime error by using the interface in a safe module.
If all modules that export a safe interface are safe, the compiler
guarantees the intrinsic safety of the interface.  If any of the modules
that export a safe interface are unsafe, it is the programmer, rather
than the compiler, who makes the guarantee.
<P>

It is a static error for a safe interface to import an unsafe one
or for a safe module to import or export an unsafe interface.
