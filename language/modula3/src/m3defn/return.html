<H1>Return</H1>
<P>

A <TT>RETURN</TT> statement for a
<A HREF="procs.html#idx.55">proper procedure</A>
has the form:
<PRE>
    RETURN
</PRE>
<P>The statement raises the return-exception without an argument.  It 
is allowed only in the body of a proper procedure.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.105>A</A>
<TT>RETURN</TT> statement for a
<A HREF="procs.html#idx.55">function procedure</A>
has the form:
<PRE>
    RETURN Expr
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>Expr</TT> is an expression assignable to the result type of 
the procedure.  The statement raises the return-exception with the 
argument <TT>Expr</TT>.  It is allowed only in the body of a function 
procedure.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.106>Failure</A>
to return a value from a function procedure is a checked runtime
error.
<P>

The effect of raising the return exception is to terminate the current
procedure activation.  To be precise, a call on a proper procedure
with body <TT>B</TT> is equivalent (after binding the arguments) to:
<PRE>
    TRY B EXCEPT return-exception => (*skip*) END
</PRE>
<P>A call on a function procedure with body <TT>B</TT> is equivalent to:
<PRE>
    TRY 
      B;  (error: no returned value)  
    EXCEPT 
      return-exception (v) => (the result becomes v)  
    END
</PRE>
