<H1>Set types</H1>
<P>

A <EM>set</EM> is a collection of values taken from some ordinal type.
A set type declaration has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = SET OF Base
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>Base</TT> is an ordinal type.  The values of <TT>T</TT> are all sets
whose elements have type <TT>Base</TT>.  For example, a variable whose
type is <TT>SET</TT> <TT>OF</TT> <TT>[0..1]</TT> can assume the following
values:
<PRE>
    {}     {0}     {1}     {0,1}
</PRE>
<P>

Implementations are expected to use the same representation for a 
<TT>SET OF T</TT> as for an <TT>ARRAY T OF BITS 1 FOR BOOLEAN</TT>.  Hence, 
programmers should expect <TT>SET OF [0..1023]</TT> to be practical,
but not <TT>SET OF INTEGER</TT>.
