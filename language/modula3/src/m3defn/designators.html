<H1>Designators</H1>
<P>

An identifier is a <EM>writable designator</EM>
if it is declared as a variable, 
is a <TT>VAR</TT> or <TT>VALUE</TT> parameter,
is a local of a <TT>TYPECASE</TT> 
or <TT>TRY EXCEPT</TT> statement,
or is a <TT>WITH</TT> local that is bound to a writable designator.
An identifier is a <EM>readonly designator</EM> if it is
a <TT>READONLY</TT> parameter,
a local of a <TT>FOR</TT> statement,
or a <TT>WITH</TT> local bound to a non-designator or 
readonly designator.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.156>The</A>
only operations that produce designators are dereferencing, 
subscripting, selection, and <TT>SUBARRAY</TT>.
This section defines these operations and specifies the conditions 
under which they produce designators.
In unsafe modules,
<A HREF="unsafe.html"><TT>LOOPHOLE</TT></A>
can also produce a designator.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.157><TT>r^</TT></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> denotes the the referent of 
    <TT>r</TT>; this operation is called <EM>dereferencing</EM>.  The
    expression <TT>r^</TT> is always a writable designator.  It is a
    static error if the type of <TT>r</TT> is <TT>REFANY</TT>,
    <TT>ADDRESS</TT>, <TT>NULL</TT>, an object type, or an opaque type,
    and a checked runtime error if <TT>r</TT> is <TT>NIL</TT>.
    The type of <TT>r^</TT> is the referent type of <TT>r</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<A NAME=idx.158><TT>a[i]</TT></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>    denotes the <TT>(i + 1 - FIRST(a))</TT>-th element of the 
    array <TT>a</TT>.  The expression <TT>a[i]</TT> is a designator
    if <TT>a</TT> is, and is writable if <TT>a</TT> is.
    The expression <TT>i</TT>
    must be assignable to the index type of <TT>a</TT>.  The type of
    <TT>a[i]</TT> is the element type of <TT>a</TT>.
    <P>

    An expression of the form <TT>a[i_1, ..., i_n]</TT> is
    shorthand for <TT>a[i_1]...[i_n]</TT>.  If <TT>a</TT> is a reference
    to an array, then <TT>a[i]</TT> is shorthand for <TT>a^[i]</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<A NAME=idx.159><TT>r.f, o.f, I.x, T.m, E.id</TT></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>    If <TT>r</TT> denotes a record,
    <TT>r.f</TT> denotes its <TT>f</TT> field.  In
    this case <TT>r.f</TT> is a designator if <TT>r</TT> is,
    and is writable if <TT>r</TT> is.
    The type of <TT>r.f</TT> is the declared type of the field.
    <P>

    <A NAME=idx.160>If</A> <TT>r</TT> is a reference to a record,
    then <TT>r.f</TT> is shorthand for <TT>r^.f</TT>.
    <P>

    <A NAME=idx.161>If</A> <TT>o</TT> denotes an object and <TT>f</TT>
    names a data field specified
    in the type of <TT>o</TT>, then <TT>o.f</TT> denotes
    that data field of <TT>o</TT>.  In this case <TT>o.f</TT> is a writable
    designator whose type is the declared type of the field.
    <P>

    If <TT>I</TT> denotes an imported interface, then <TT>I.x</TT> denotes 
    the entity named <TT>x</TT> in the interface <TT>I</TT>.  In this case 
    <TT>I.x</TT> is a designator if <TT>x</TT> is declared as a variable; 
    such a designator is always writable.
    <P>

    <A NAME=idx.162>If</A> <TT>T</TT> is an object type and <TT>m</TT>
    is the name of one of 
    <TT>T</TT>'s methods, then <TT>T.m</TT> denotes the <TT>m</TT> method of
    type <TT>T</TT>. In this case <TT>T.m</TT> is not a designator.  Its type
    is the procedure type whose first argument has mode <TT>VALUE</TT>
    and type <TT>T</TT>, and whose remaining arguments are determined by
    the method declaration for <TT>m</TT> in <TT>T</TT>. The name of the first
    argument is unspecified; thus in calls to <TT>T.m</TT>, this argument
    must be given positionally, not by keyword.  <TT>T.m</TT> is a
    procedure constant.
    <P>

    <A NAME=idx.163>If</A> <TT>E</TT> is an enumerated type,
    then <TT>E.id</TT> denotes its
    value named <TT>id</TT>.  In this case <TT>E.id</TT> is not a designator.
    The type of <TT>E.id</TT> is <TT>E</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<A NAME=idx.164>
<TT>SUBARRAY(a: Array; from, for: CARDINAL): ARRAY OF ElemType(a)</TT>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>    <TT>SUBARRAY</TT> produces a subarray of <TT>a</TT>.  It does not copy the
    array; it is a designator if <TT>a</TT> is, and is writable if <TT>a</TT>
    is.  If <TT>a</TT> is a multi-dimensional array, <TT>SUBARRAY</TT> applies
    only to the top-level array.
    <P>

    <A NAME=idx.165>The</A> operation returns the subarray that skips the
    first <TT>from</TT>
    elements of <TT>a</TT> and contains the next <TT>for</TT> elements.  Note
    that if <TT>from</TT> is zero, the subarray is a prefix of <TT>a</TT>,
    whether the type of <TT>a</TT> is zero-based or not.  It is a checked
    runtime error if <TT>from+for</TT> exceeds <TT>NUMBER(a)</TT>.
    <P>

    <A NAME=idx.166>Implementations</A> may restrict
    or prohibit the <TT>SUBARRAY</TT> operation for arrays with packed
    element types.
