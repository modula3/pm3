<BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>
There are two basic methods of declaring high or low before the showdown
in all High-Low Poker games.  They are (1) simultaneous declarations,
and (2) consecutive declarations <TT>....</TT>  It is a sad but true fact that
the consecutive method spoils the game.

<A NAME=idx.119>A</A>
declaration introduces a name for a constant, type, variable, exception,
or procedure.  The scope of the name is the block containing the
declaration.  A block has the form:
<PRE>
    Decls BEGIN S END
</PRE>
<P><A NAME=idx.120>where</A>
<TT>Decls</TT> is a sequence of declarations and <TT>S</TT> is a
statement, the executable part of the block.  A block can appear as
a statement or as the body of a module or procedure.  The declarations
of a block can introduce a name at most once, though a name can be
redeclared in nested blocks, and a procedure declared in an interface
can be redeclared in a
<A HREF="units.html">module</A>
exporting the interface.
The order of declarations
in a block does not matter, except to determine the order of
initialization of variables.
<P>

Each type of declaration is described below
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="type-decl.html">Types</A>
<LI><A HREF="constants.html">Constants</A>
<LI><A HREF="variables.html">Variables</A>
<LI><A HREF="procedures.html">Procedures</A>
<LI><A HREF="exceptions.html">Exceptions</A>
<LI><A HREF="opaques.html">Opaque types</A>
<LI><A HREF="revelations.html">Revelations</A>
<LI><A HREF="recursion.html">Recursive declarations</A>
</UL>
