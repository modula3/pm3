<A NAME=idx.22>A</A>
Modula-3 program specifies a computation that acts on a sequence 
of digital components called <EM>locations</EM>.  A <EM>variable</EM> is a set 
of locations that represents a mathematical value according to a 
convention determined by the variable's <EM>type</EM>.  If a value can 
be represented by some variable of type <TT>T</TT>, then we say that 
the value is a <EM>member</EM> of <TT>T</TT> and <TT>T</TT> <EM>contains</EM> 
the value.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.23>An</A>
<EM>identifier</EM> is a symbol declared as a name for a variable, type,
procedure, etc.  The region of the program over which a declaration
applies is called the <EM>scope</EM> of the declaration.  Scopes can be
nested.  The meaning of an identifier is determined by the smallest
enclosing scope in which the identifier is declared.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.24>An</A>
<EM>expression</EM> specifies a computation that produces a value 
or variable.  Expressions that produce variables are called 
<EM>designators</EM>.  A designator can denote either a variable or the value 
of that variable, depending on the context.  Some designators are 
<EM>readonly</EM>, which means that they cannot be used in contexts that might 
change the value of the variable.  A designator that is not readonly 
is called <EM>writable</EM>. Expressions 
whose values can be determined statically are called <EM>constant 
expressions</EM>; they are never designators.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.25>A</A>
<EM>static error</EM> is an error that the implementation must detect 
before program execution.  Violations of the language definition 
are static errors unless they are explicitly classified as runtime 
errors.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.26>A</A>
<EM>checked runtime error</EM> is an error that the implementation 
must detect and report at runtime.  The method for reporting such 
errors is implementation-dependent.  (If the implementation maps 
them into exceptions, then a program could handle these exceptions 
and continue.)
<P>

<A NAME=idx.27>An</A>
<EM>unchecked runtime error</EM> is an error that is not guaranteed 
to be detected, and can cause the subsequent behavior of the 
computation to be arbitrary.  Unchecked runtime errors can occur 
only in unsafe modules.
