<H1>Try Finally</H1>
<P>

A statement of the form:
<PRE>
    TRY S_1 FINALLY S_2 END
</PRE>
<P>executes statement <TT>S_1</TT> and then statement <TT>S_2</TT>.  
If the outcome of <TT>S_1</TT> is normal, the <TT>TRY</TT> statement 
is equivalent to <TT>S_1; S_2</TT>.  If the outcome of <TT>
S_1</TT> is an exception and the outcome of <TT>S_2</TT> is normal, 
the exception from <TT>S_1</TT> is re-raised after <TT>S_2</TT> 
is executed.  If both outcomes are exceptions, the outcome of the 
<TT>TRY</TT> is the exception from <TT>S_2</TT>.
