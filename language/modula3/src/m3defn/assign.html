<H2>Assignment</H2>
<P>

To specify the typechecking of assignment statements we need to define 
"assignable", which is a relation between types and types, between 
expressions and variables, and between expressions and types.
<P>

A type <TT>T</TT> is <EM>assignable</EM> to a type <TT>U</TT> if:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>T &lt;: U</TT>, or
<LI> <TT>U &lt;: T</TT> and <TT>T</TT> is an array or a reference type other 
     than <TT>ADDRESS</TT>
     (This restriction is lifted in
     <A HREF="unsafe.html">unsafe modules</A>.), or
<LI> <TT>T</TT> and <TT>U</TT> are ordinal types with at least one member 
     in common. 
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="idx.80">An</A>
expression <TT>e</TT> is <EM>assignable</EM> to a variable <TT>v</TT> if:
<UL>
<LI> the type of <TT>e</TT> is assignable to the type of <TT>v</TT>, and
<LI> the value of <TT>e</TT> is a member of the type of <TT>v</TT>, is 
     not a local procedure, and if it is an array, then it has the same 
     shape as <TT>v</TT>.
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="idx.81">The</A>
first point can be checked statically; the others generally require 
runtime checks. Since there is no way to determine statically whether 
the value of a procedure parameter is local or global, assigning 
a local procedure is a runtime rather than a static error.
<P>

An expression <TT>e</TT> is <EM>assignable</EM> to a type <TT>T</TT>
if <TT>e</TT> is assignable to some variable of type <TT>T</TT>.
(If <TT>T</TT> is not an open array type, this is the same as saying
that <TT>e</TT> is assignable to any variable of type <TT>T</TT>.)
<P>

<A NAME="idx.82">An</A>
assignment statement has the form:
<PRE>
    v := e
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>v</TT> is a writable designator and <TT>e</TT> is an expression
assignable to the variable designated by <TT>v</TT>.  The statement sets
<TT>v</TT> to the value of <TT>e</TT>.  The order of evaluation of
<TT>v</TT> and <TT>e</TT> is undefined, but <TT>e</TT> will be evaluated before
<TT>v</TT> is updated.
In particular, if <TT>v</TT> and <TT>e</TT> are overlapping
<A HREF="designators.html#idx.164">subarrays</A>,
the assignment is performed in such a way that no element is used
as a target before it is used as a source.
<P>

Examples of assignments:
<PRE>
    VAR
      x: REFANY;
      a: REF INTEGER;
      b: REF BOOLEAN;

    a := b;  (* static error *)
    x := a;  (* no possible error *)
    a := x   (* possible checked runtime error *)
</PRE>
<P>

<A NAME="idx.83">The</A>
same comments would apply if <TT>x</TT> had an ordinal type with 
non-overlapping subranges <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT>, or if <TT>x</TT> had 
an object type and <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT> had incompatible subtypes.  
The type <TT>ADDRESS</TT> is treated differently from other reference 
types, since a runtime check cannot be performed on the assignment 
of raw addresses.  For example:
<PRE>
    VAR
      x: ADDRESS;
      a: UNTRACED REF INTEGER;
      b: UNTRACED REF BOOLEAN;

    a := b;  (* static error *)
    x := a;  (* no possible error *)
    a := x   (* static error in safe modules *)
</PRE>
