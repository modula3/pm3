<H2>Try Except</H2>
<P>

A <TT>TRY-EXCEPT</TT> statement has the form:
<PRE>
    TRY
      Body
    EXCEPT 
      id_1 (v_1) => Handler_1
    | ... 
    | id_n (v_n) => Handler_n
    ELSE Handler_0 
    END
</PRE>
where <TT>Body</TT> and each <TT>Handler</TT> are statements,
each <TT>id</TT> names an exception, and each <TT>v_i</TT> is an identifier.
The "<TT>ELSE Handler_0</TT>" and each "<TT>(v_i)</TT>" are optional.  
It is a static error for an exception to be named more than once 
in the list of <TT>id</TT>'s.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.97>The</A>
statement executes <TT>Body</TT>.  If the outcome is normal, the 
except clause is ignored.  If <TT>Body</TT> raises any listed exception 
<TT>id_i</TT>, then <TT>Handler_i</TT> is executed.  If <TT>Body</TT> 
raises any other exception and "<TT>ELSE Handler_0</TT>" is present, 
then it is executed.  In either case, the outcome of the <TT>TRY</TT> 
statement is the outcome of the selected handler.  If <TT>Body</TT> 
raises an unlisted exception and "<TT>ELSE Handler_0</TT>" is 
absent, then the outcome of the <TT>TRY</TT> statement is the exception 
raised by <TT>Body</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.98>Each</A>
<TT>(v_i)</TT> declares a variable whose type is the argument 
type of the exception <TT>id_i</TT> and whose scope is
<TT>Handler_i</TT>. When an exception <TT>id_i</TT> paired with an 
argument <TT>x</TT> is handled, <TT>v_i</TT> is initialized to
<TT>x</TT> before <TT>Handler_i</TT> is executed.  It is a static error 
to include <TT>(v_i)</TT> if exception <TT>id_i</TT> does not take 
an argument.  
<P>

If <TT>(v_i)</TT> is absent, then <TT>id_i</TT> can be a list of 
exceptions separated by commas, as shorthand for a list in 
which the rest of the handler is repeated for each exception.
That is:
<PRE>
    id_1, ..., id_n => Handler
</PRE>
is shorthand for:
<PRE>
    id_1 => Handler; ...; id_n => Handler
</PRE>
<P>

<A NAME=idx.99>It</A>
is a checked runtime error to raise an exception outside the dynamic 
scope of a handler for that exception.  A "<TT>TRY EXCEPT ELSE</TT>"
counts as a handler for all exceptions.
<P>
