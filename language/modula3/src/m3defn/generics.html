<H1>Generics</H1>
<P>

In a generic interface or module, some of the imported interface names
are treated as formal parameters, to be bound to actual interfaces
when the generic is instantiated.
<P>

A generic interface has the form
<PRE>
    GENERIC INTERFACE G(F_1, ..., F_n);
      Body
    END G.
</PRE>    
<P>where <TT>G</TT> is an identifier that names the generic interface,
<TT>F_1</TT>, <TT>...</TT>, <TT>F_n</TT> is a list of identifiers, called
the formal imports of <TT>G</TT>, and <TT>Body</TT> is a sequence of imports
followed by a sequence of declarations, exactly as in a non-generic
interface.
<P>

An instance of <TT>G</TT> has the form
<PRE>
    INTERFACE I = G(A_1, ..., A_n) END I.
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>I</TT> is the name of the instance and <TT>A_1</TT>, <TT>...</TT>,
<TT>A_n</TT> is a list of actual interfaces to which the formal imports
of <TT>G</TT> are bound.  The instance <TT>I</TT> is equivalent to an ordinary
interface defined as follows: 
<PRE>
    INTERFACE I;
      IMPORT A_1 AS F_1, ..., A_n AS F_n;
      Body
    END I.
</PRE>
<P>

<A NAME=idx.146>A</A>
generic module has the form
<PRE>
    GENERIC MODULE G(F_1, ..., F_n);
      Body
    END G.
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>G</TT> is an identifier that names the generic module,
<TT>F_1</TT>, <TT>...</TT>, <TT>F_n</TT> is a list of identifiers, called
the formal imports of <TT>G</TT>, and <TT>Body</TT> is a sequence of imports
followed by a block, exactly as in a non-generic module.
<P>

An instance of <TT>G</TT> has the form
<PRE>
    MODULE I EXPORTS E = G(A_1, ..., A_n) END I.
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>I</TT> is the name of the instance,
<TT>E</TT> is a list of interfaces exported
by <TT>I</TT>, and <TT>A_1</TT>, <TT>...</TT>,
<TT>A_n</TT> is a list of actual interfaces to which the formal
imports of <TT>G</TT> are bound.
"<TT>EXPORTS E</TT>" can be omitted, in which case
it defaults to "<TT>EXPORTS I</TT>".
The instance <TT>I</TT> is equivalent
to an ordinary module defined as follows:
<PRE>
    MODULE I EXPORTS E;
      IMPORT A_1 AS F_1, ..., A_n AS F_n;
      Body
    END I.
</PRE>
<P>Notice that the generic module itself has no exports; they are supplied
only when it is instantiated.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.147>For</A>
example, here is a generic stack package:
<PRE>
    GENERIC INTERFACE Stack(Elem);
      (* where Elem.T is not an open array type. *)
      TYPE T &lt;: REFANY;
      PROCEDURE Create(): T;
      PROCEDURE Push(VAR s: T; x: Elem.T);
      PROCEDURE Pop(VAR s: T): Elem.T;
    END Stack.

    GENERIC MODULE Stack(Elem);

      REVEAL 
        T = BRANDED OBJECT  n: INTEGER;  a: REF ARRAY OF Elem.T  END;

      PROCEDURE Create(): T =
        BEGIN  RETURN NEW(T, n := 0, a := NIL)  END Create;

      PROCEDURE Push(VAR s: T; x: Elem.T) =
        BEGIN
          IF s.a = NIL THEN 
            s.a := NEW(REF ARRAY OF Elem.T, 5)
          ELSIF s.n &gt; LAST(s.a^) THEN
            WITH temp = NEW(REF ARRAY OF Elem.T, 2 * NUMBER(s.a^)) DO
              FOR i := 0 TO LAST(s.a^) DO temp[i] := s.a[i] END;
              s.a := temp
            END
          END;
          s.a[s.n] := x;
          INC(s.n)
        END Push;

      PROCEDURE Pop(VAR s: T): Elem.T =
        BEGIN  DEC(s.n);  RETURN s.a[s.n]  END Pop;

    BEGIN
    END Stack.
</PRE>
<P>To instantiate these generics to produce stacks of integers: 
<PRE>
    INTERFACE Integer; TYPE T = INTEGER; END Integer.
    INTERFACE IntStack = Stack(Integer) END IntStack.
    MODULE IntStack = Stack(Integer) END IntStack.
</PRE>
<P>Implementations are not expected to share code between different
instances of a generic module, since this will not be possible in
general.
<P>

Implementations are not required to typecheck uninstantiated generics,
but they must typecheck their instances.  For example, if one made
the following mistake:
<PRE>
    INTERFACE String; TYPE T = ARRAY OF CHAR; END String.
    INTERFACE StringStack = Stack(String) END StringStack.
    MODULE StringStack = Stack(String) END StringStack.
</PRE>
<P>everything would go well until the last line, when the compiler would
attempt to compile a version of <TT>Stack</TT> in which the element type
was an open array.  It would then complain that the <TT>NEW</TT> call
in <TT>Push</TT> does not have enough parameters.
<P>
