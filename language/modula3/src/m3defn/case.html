<H2>Case</H2>
<P>

A <TT>CASE</TT> statement has the form:
<PRE>
    CASE Expr OF  
      L_1 => S_1 
    | ...
    | L_n => S_n
    ELSE S_0 
    END
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>Expr</TT> is an expression whose type is an ordinal type and 
each <TT>L</TT> is a list of constant expressions or ranges of constant 
expressions denoted by "<TT>e_1..e_2</TT>", which represent 
the values from <TT>e_1</TT> to <TT>e_2</TT> inclusive.  If <TT>
e_1</TT> exceeds <TT>e_2</TT>, the range is empty.  It is a static 
error if the sets represented by any two <TT>L</TT>'s overlap or if 
the value of any of the constant expressions is not a member of the 
type of <TT>Expr</TT>.  The "<TT>ELSE S_0</TT>" is optional.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.114>The</A>
statement evaluates <TT>Expr</TT>.  If the resulting value is in any
<TT>L_i</TT>, then <TT>S_i</TT> is executed.  If the value is
in no <TT>L_i</TT> and "<TT>ELSE S_0</TT>" is present, then it is executed.
If the value is in no <TT>L_i</TT> and "<TT>ELSE S_0</TT>" is absent,
a checked runtime error occurs.
<P>
