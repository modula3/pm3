<H1>The SGML Parser Library</H1>

<P CLASS=MD.SKIPALL> A printable version of this documentation is available
<A HREF="index.doc">[sgml]</A></P>

<DIV CLASS=ABSTRACT>
<P>
This library reads SGML document types definitions and parses SGML files
accordingly. It may be used for parsing, checking, or converting SGML
files.
</DIV>

<P>
The Standard
Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a structured document representation
suitable for document manipulation, exchange and storage
<A HREF="http://www.sil.org/sgml/sgml.html">[SGML]</A>. Among other
things SGML is the format upon which is based HTML, the World Wide
Web Hypertext Markup Language <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">[HTML]</A>.

<H2>Organization</H2>

<P>
A first version of this library was built on top of James Clark
NSGMLS C++ SGML parser, a fully validating and stable parser.
Subsequent versions may still use the NSGMLS parser, if the quake variable
<TT>USE_NSGMLS</TT> is true in the <TT>m3makefile</TT> when compiling
the library, but default to a native Modula-3 XML/SGML parser.
XML is a subset of SGML being defined by the World Wide Web consortium
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">[XML]</A>.
<P>
The native Modula-3 library was developed with the goal of removing
dependencies on foreign packages (NSGMLS) which needed to be installed
separately. Implementing a fully validating SGML parser, however,
is a significant task (NSGMLS weights in at 50000 lines).
Thus, a subset of SGML, based on XML, was implemented; several secondary
options are not implemented. Nonetheless, the
implementation goes beyond XML since the HTML 3.2/4.0 document type
definitions needed to be handled, as well as common HTML documents.
Among other things, tags validation was required in order to detect and
supply omitted tags.
<P>
Therefore, while the native Modula-3 SGML parser backend still has
some limitations, a large part of the needed underlying machinery has
been implemented. It has been relatively easy to extend as more
features were required. It is expected to continue evolving as it gains
more widespread use and as the XML standard matures.
<P>
The default path for catalogs is PKG_INSTALL/sgml/src/dtd,
where PKG_INSTALL is defined in the <TT>m3build</TT> template
(e.g. /usr/local/modula3-3.6/lib/m3/pkg) for the Modula-3 parser.
For NSGMLS, the default value depends on how it was compiled.
Document type definitions are provided in this package for HTML 3.2,
HTML 4.0, Math HTML, and Linuxdoc.
