<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<I>mtex2tex</I> is a filter that reads a file in
<A HREF="mtex.7.html">mtex(7)</A> format from its standard input, and
writes a <I>LaTeX</I>-format file to standard output suitable for
processing with latex(1).<P>

In the output produced by <I>mtex2tex</I>, the title of the manpage is
a LaTeX <TT>\section</TT>, and the sections of the manpage are LaTeX
<TT>\subsection</TT>s. The output does not contain a
<TT>\documentstyle</TT> declaration, nor <TT>\begin{document}</TT> and
<TT>\end{document}</TT> environment brackets. It is assumed that the
output from this filter will be <TT>\input</TT> into some other
top-level LaTeX document containing these commands, like this:
<PRE>
  \documentstyle{article}
  \begin{document}
  \title{The \it{mtex} Package Manpages}
  \author{Harvey Throgenbottom}
  \date{\today}
  \maketitle
  \input{mtex.7.tex}
  \input{mtex2html.1.tex}
  \input{mtex2man.1.tex}
  \input{mtex2tex.1.tex}
  \end{document}
</PRE>

<I>mtex2tex</I> is written entirely in LIM (see lim(1)).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>SPECIAL CHARACTERS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

There are several special characters for the LaTeX output format. Here
are the characters and the strings they are translated to by
mtex2tex(1):<P>

"<TT>$</TT>" becomes "<TT>\$</TT>"<BR>
"<TT>&amp;</TT>" becomes "<TT>\&amp;</TT>"<BR>
"<TT>%</TT>" becomes "<TT>\%</TT>"<BR>
"<TT>#</TT>" becomes "<TT>\#</TT>"<BR>
"<TT>_</TT>" becomes "<TT>\_</TT>"<BR>
"<TT>{</TT>" becomes "<TT>\{</TT>"<BR>
"<TT>}</TT>" becomes "<TT>\}</TT>"<BR>
"<TT>~</TT>" becomes "<TT>{\tt\symbol{'176}}</TT>"<BR>
"<TT>^</TT>" becomes "<TT>{\tt\symbol{'136}}</TT>"<BR>
"<TT>\</TT>" becomes "<TT>{\tt\symbol{'134}}</TT>"
<BR>
<P>

To prevent these characters from being translated within the
scope of a <I>tex</I> environment, you must escape them with a
<TT>\</TT> (backslash) character.

<H3>DIAGNOSTICS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

See the <A HREF="mtex.7.html#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</A> section
of the mtex(7) manpage for a complete description.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>BUGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

There is no way to specify that the space following a period should
be the interword space in the case that the period does not end the
sentence. Similarly, there is no way to indicate that a period
following an uppercase letter actually ends a sentence.<P>

By default, most LaTeX document styles do not skip a line to start a
new paragraph. Instead, they indent the first line of the
paragraph. This can lead to formatting anomalies compared to the
HTML- and man-formatted versions of a manpage.<P>

By default, most LaTeX document styles skip a line between list
environment items, even if no new paragraph is indicated
between them.<P>

By default, most LaTeX document styles skip a line before the first
line of an environment and after the last line of the environment,
even if no new paragraph is indicated there.<P>

The text following items in a description environment does not start
on a new line.<P>

Links are not indicated in any way.
