% Standard configuration file for IBMR2
%
%  This configuration assumes that you have installed bsdcc as
%  described in "Porting 4.3 BSD Programs to AIX Version 3.1.
%  The following is a simple form of these instructions.
%  
%     (1) Add the following stanza to /etc/xlc.cfg:
%  
%  * standard c compiler aliased as bsdcc
%  bsdcc:  use        = DEFLT
%          crt        = /lib/crt0.o
%          mcrt       = /lib/mcrt0.o
%          gcrt       = /lib/gcrt0.o
%          libraries  = -lbsd, -lc
%          proflibs   = -L/lib/profiled,-L/usr/lib/profiled
%          options    = -H512,-T512, -qlanglvl=extended, -qnoro, -D_BSD,
%  -D_NONSTD_TYPES, -D_NO_PROTO, -D_BSD_INCLUDES, -bnodelcsect, -U__STR__,
%  -U__MATH__
%  
%      Note that the options are a single line.
%  
%     (2) As root, execute the following statements:
%  
%     	cd /bin
%  	ln -s xlc bsdcc
%  
%     The result is to make bsdcc a C compiler that is as closely
%     compatible with 4.3 BSD as possible.  The porting guide
%     discusses the remaining incompatibilities.  The troff source
%     for a version of the porting document is in file
%     /usr/lpp/bos/bsdport.tr.
%  
%   ALSO NOTE:  There is a bug in earlier versions of the 3.2 xlc compiler
%   that will give you compilation errors.  The earliest version known to
%   compile m3 2.10(and above) is 1.2.0.7.  1.2.0.0 does not work.  To see
%   which version you have, type "/usr/ucb/what /usr/lpp/xlc/bin/xlcentry".
