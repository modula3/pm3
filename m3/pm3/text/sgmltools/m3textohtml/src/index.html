<H1>M3textohtml: From the M3totex Literate Programming System to M3doc</H1>

<DIV CLASS=ABSTRACT>
<P>This program is to be used to ease the transition from M3totex to M3doc
as a literate programming system. Once all Modula-3 interfaces containing
TeX commands are translated, it will become useless.
</DIV>

<P>
A number of Modula-3 interfaces, generic interfaces, and some modules, 
contain TeX commands. This program converts most common TeX commands
embedded in Modula-3 comments to their equivalent HTML tag. It reads
a TeX commented Modula-3 unit from standard input, prints messages about
unrecognized TeX commands, and output the translated unit to standard output.
<P>
Bibliographic references (\cite{}) are converted to hypertext links into
a file named <TT>references.html</TT> in the package <TT>src</TT> directory.
The actual bibliographic entries need to be entered into that file.
<P>
While most TeX commands are translated properly, some final manual
adjustments may be needed. Often, TeX commands embedded into strings
in quoted, backquoted, index or verbatim sections are not processed.
<P>
A shell script, <TT>tex2ht</TT>,  is provided to run <TT>m3textohtml</TT> 
over all interface files in several Modula-3 packages. Use with caution
and always keep a copy of these packages as the conversion is done
<I>in place</I>.
<P>
The number of files within SRC Modula-3 requiring conversion has been
estimated to 250 interfaces and 30 modules. This information was obtained
by searching for \ in all the .i3, .ig, .m3, and .mg files. While any file
with a \ may contain TeX commands, a smaller subset is more likely:
those with \ followed by something else than the usual Modula-3 escape 
sequences (\n, \r, \" ...). This information is provided below for
modules and interfaces.
