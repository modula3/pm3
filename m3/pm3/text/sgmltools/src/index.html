<H1>Library and Tools for Processing SGML/HTML Documentation</H1>

<DIV CLASS=ABSTRACT>
<P>The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a structured format
for encoding document content. Several SGML Document Type Definitions (DTD)
are in common use, like HTML, CALS, and Linuxdoc. A library and several tools
have been developped to read and transform SGML documents.
</DIV>

<P>
The <TT>sgml</TT> library parses SGML documents according to their DTD.
Several tools use the <TT>sgml</TT> library to check the structure of
SGML documents (<TT>sgmlstructure</TT>), add the omitted tags
(<TT>sgmlnormalize</TT>), convert to other formats (<TT>sgmlconv</TT>), and
group a tree of several SGML documents into a larger linear one 
(<TT>sgmllinear</TT>). The package <TT>sgmlobliq</TT> exports the objects
and methods of the <TT>sgml</TT> library to the Obliq interpreter; it was
used for a prototype of <TT>sgmlconv</TT>
<P>
A number of tools are more directly targeted at documenting Modula-3
packages, based on the <TT>m3doc</TT> system. These include 
<TT>m3tosgml</TT> and <TT>sgmltom3</TT> to transform Modula-3 interfaces
with embedded documentation into HTML documents, <TT>sgmllinear</TT>
to group several HTML files and documented Modula-3 interfaces into a 
large linear HTML document, and <TT>sgmlconv</TT> to convert the
resulting HTML file into LaTeX for typesetting and printing.
The package <TT>m3textohtml</TT> is used to convert Modula-3 interfaces
documented for processing with <TT>m3totex</TT> into interfaces suitable for
<TT>m3tosgml</TT>.

<H2>Installation</H2>
<P>
This is the first release for most of these tools and should be considered
alpha. On POSIX systems, you may use the main m3makefile to build at once
all the contained packages. The packages are built in two phases. In the
first phase all the libraries and programs are constructed; the documentation
is not processed since the tools are not built yet. In the second phase,
everything is build, including the documentation. The HTML documentation
may then be found in HTML_INSTALL/sgmltools/src/index.html and the
Postscript documentation in DOC_INSTALL/m3doc/index.ps
