<H1>The Documentation Format</H1>
<P>
The document type definition (DTD) follows the HTML 4.0 draft, minus all the
interactive features (forms, scripts, applets), plus
MathHTML draft 97-07-10 (e.g. for browers supporting MathHTML: 
<MATH>
  <MROW>
    <MROOT>
      <MROW>

and a number of extensions. Even though these drafts
are evolving, the processing tools are modular and can easily be adapted. 
Moreover, with a well structured content describing format, 
it is relatively easy to migrate documents to a different expression 
of the structure
(i.e. different tag names). The extensions are mostly accomodated within
the existing tags and attributes. They are detailed in the following
sections.

<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>html</SPAN></SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>math</SPAN></SPAN>

<H2>Title page information</H2>
<P>
The following elements must be present in root HTML files used
to generate printed documentation. They are ignored in included
documents.

<UL>
<LI> A list of authors, with references to their affiliation.
<LI> A list of affiliations.
<LI> Copyright notice.
<LI> The date of last update.
<LI> A list of keywords. The following keywords are recommended:
     graphics, programming, network, text, animation, 3D, database,
     user interface, io, system, algorithm, data structure, thread,
     runtime, parsing, tool, static analysis, dynamic analysis,
     alpha, beta, stable, mature, wide audience, narrow audience,
     tutorial, reusable. These keywords are used when searching
     tools and libraries relevant for a particular task, as well as
     when selecting automatically the packages to download/install
     depending on the interests and space availability of the
     prospective user.

<H2>Sectioning</H2>
<P>
The document structure is based on nested sections, each section starting
with a title. In HTML, the nesting of sections is implicit and deduced from
the heading level. Besides the core sections, there are the abstract
and the appendices which need to be suitably identified. The abstract may
be used as a summary for the document. The appendices may be grouped,
numbered separately, and placed at the end when several HTML files are
grouped during a linearization.

<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>abstract</SPAN></SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>appendix</SPAN></SPAN>

<PRE>
&lt;HEAD>&lt;TITLE>This is the title but is redundant&lt;/TITLE>
&lt;/HEAD>&lt;BODY>
&lt;H1>This is the title for real&lt;/H1>
  &lt;P> First paragraph &lt;/P>
&lt;DIV CLASS=ABSTRACT>
    &lt;P>A real short abstract. &lt;/P>
&lt;/DIV>
&lt;H2>Introduction&lt;/H2>
  &lt;P>This is all about gnus and gnats as usual. &lt;/P>
&lt;H2>Motivation&lt;/H2>
  &lt;H3>History&lt;/H3>
    &lt;P> Once upon a time... &lt;/P>

  &lt;H2>Biological characteristics of gnus&lt;/H2>

  &lt;H2>Biological characteristics of gnats&lt;/H2>
    ...
&lt;/DIV>
</PRE>

<H2>Bibliographical references</H2>
<P>
In an hypertext document, references may point to an html file on the Web,
to a bibliographic entry for the referenced document, or to both.
The following classes are used to distinguish the three cases, and their
treatment is described.

<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>reference entry</SPAN></SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>hypertext link</SPAN></SPAN>

<DL>
<DT>BIB.REF<DD> The URL is added to the text between parenthesis.
  When no class is specified, BIB.REF is assumed.
<DT>BIB.ENTRY<DD> The entry found at the URL is added to the table
  of references.
<DT>BIB.NOREF<DD> Nothing is added to the table of references, usually
  because a BIB.ENTRY link is already present and should go in the
  table of references.
</DL>
<P>
The referenced bibliographic entries must use the following classes,
with the specified fields, inspired from the LaTeX bibtex entries.

<DL>
<DT>BIB.ARTICLE<DD> Fields: author, title, journal, year, and optionally
  volume, number, pages, month, url, note.

<DT>BIB.BOOK<DD> Fields: author or editor, title, publisher, year, 
  and optionally
  volume/number, series, address, edition, month, url, note.

<DT>BIB.BOOKLET<DD> Fields: title, and optionally author, howpublished, 
  address, month, year, url, note.

<DT>BIB.INBOOK<DD> Fields: author or editor, title, chapter and/or pages,
  publisher, year, and optionally volume or number, series, type, address,
  edition, month, url, note.

<DT>BIB.INCOLLECTION<DD> Fields: author, title, booktitle, publisher, year,
  and optionally volume or number, series, type, chapter, pages, address, 
  edition, month, url, note.

<DT>BIB.INPROCEEDINGS<DD> Fields: author, title, booktitle, year, and
  optionally editor, volume or number, series, pages, address, month,
  organization, publisher, url, note.

<DT>BIB.MANUAL<DD> Fields: title, and optionally author, organization,
  address, edition, month, year, url, note.

<DT>BIB.MSTHESIS<DD> Fields: author, title, school, year, and optionally
  type, address, month, url, note.

<DT>BIB.PHDTHESIS<DD> Fields: author, title, school, year, and optionally
  type, address, month, url, note.

<DT>BIB.MISCENTRY<DD> Fields: optionally author, title, howpublished,
  month, year, url, note.

<DT>BIB.PROCEEDINGS<DD> Fields: title, year, and optionally editor, volume or
  number, series, address, month, organization, publisher, url, note.

<DT>BIB.TECHREPORT<DD> Fields: author, title, institution, year, and
  optionally type, number, address, month, url, note.

<DT>BIB.UNPUBLISHED<DD> Fields: author, title, note, and optionally month,

</DL>
<P>
The document then contains a number of references, some of which point to
entries, usually in a separate bibliographic database.

<PRE>
Document.html:

The entries are based on the bibtex/LaTeX
  &lt;A REL="BIB.NOREF" HREF="http://www.latex.org/manual.html">[LaTeX]&lt;/A>
  &lt;A REL="BIB.ENTRY" HREF="../bib/BibEntries.html#lamport1985">&lt;/A>,
a popular typesetting system for gnus and gnats.

BibEntries.html:

&lt;DIV ID="Doe1997" CLASS=BIB.ARTICLE>

&lt;SPAN CLASS=AUTHOR>Mary Doe&lt;/SPAN>
&lt;SPAN CLASS=TITLE>Gnus and Gnats&lt;/SPAN>
&lt;SPAN CLASS=JOURNAL>Software Review&lt;/SPAN>
&lt;SPAN CLASS=YEAR>1997&lt;/SPAN>
&lt;/DIV>

&lt;SPAN CLASS=ADDRESS>Reading, Massachusetts&lt;/SPAN>
&lt;SPAN CLASS=YEAR>1985&lt;/SPAN>
&lt;/DIV>
</PRE>

<H2>Internal References</H2>
<P>
Bibliographical references are used to access material outside of the
current document. Internal references point the reader to a section,
table, figure... through its number (by default and when REL=REF.NUMBER),
or page (when REL=REF.PAGE).
<!-- footnote affiliation -->
The corresponding target (section, table, figure...) must be named
with the ID or NAME attribute.

<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>references</SPAN>
  <SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>internal</SPAN></SPAN>

<PRE>
The evolution of gnu populations are shown in Table 
  &lt;A REL=REF.NUMBER HREF="#gnutable">[gnu table]&lt;/A>,
on page
  &lt;A REL=REF.PAGE HREF="#gnutable">[]&lt;/A>,
...
&lt;TABLE ID="gnutable">
  &lt;CAPTION> Gnu populations in North America from 1800 to 1900&lt;/CAPTION>
  &lt;TR>...
&lt;/TABLE>
</PRE>

<H2>Indexing</H2>
<P>
Index marks are used to collect for a document the list of pages where
an important topic is discussed. In some cases, begin and end marks delineate
a section where the topic is discussed, and the corresponding page range
appears in the index. The term printed in the index may
not be the correct key for sorting. Indeed, terms may start with a capital
letter, or be emphasized to indicate the that the term is first defined
here.

<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>index</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
A simple index mark is indicated by a SPAN element of CLASS INDEX.MARK.
It contains a list of usually no more than three
SPAN elements of class INDEX.KEY, each possibly followed by a SPAN element 
of CLASS INDEX.TEXT
when the text to print differs from the sorting key.
It may end with a list of SPAN elements of CLASS INDEX.SEE to refer
to another index item. 
<P>
When a text range is to be delineated for the index, two index marks
are used, one with CLASS INDEX.MARK.BEGIN and the other with CLASS
INDEX.MARK.END. These may not contain INDEX.SEE elements, and the
contained INDEX.KEY and INDEX.TEXT elements must match
those in the corresponding begin/end mark.
<PRE>
This section discusses the Gnu population size variations over time and
geographical area.
&lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>gnu&lt;/SPAN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.TEXT>&lt;EM>Gnu&lt;/EM>&lt;/SPAN> 
    &lt;!-- Gnu is emphasized because first defined here -->
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>population&lt;/SPAN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.TEXT>Population&lt;/SPAN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>size&lt;/SPAN>
&lt;/SPAN>
&lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>gnu&lt;/SPAN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.TEXT>&lt;EM>Gnu&lt;/EM>&lt;/SPAN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>population&lt;/SPAN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.TEXT>Population&lt;/SPAN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>growth&lt;/SPAN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.SEE>gnu&lt;/SPAN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.SEE>population&lt;/SPAN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.SEE>size&lt;/SPAN>
&lt;/SPAN>
Various causes affect the Gnu population size.
&lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK.BEGIN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>gnat&lt;/SPAN>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.TEXT>&lt;EM>Gnat&lt;/EM>&lt;/SPAN>
&lt;/SPAN>
Most significantly, the presence of gnat has a direct correlation with
gnu health problems.
&lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK.END>
  &lt;SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>gnat&lt;/SPAN>
&lt;/SPAN>
</PRE>

<H2>Figures</H2>
<P>
The current HTML practice is to use bitmaps for anything graphical;
in some cases, a vector format like Postscript or CGM is used.
By representing diagrams as structured elements, one allows further
editing and reuse of the diagrams, insures that the diagrams can be
represented at the full resolution of the output device, and allows
spell checking and cut/paste of any text within the diagram.

<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>figure</SPAN></SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>drawing</SPAN></SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>postscript</SPAN></SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>picture</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
The following elements are introduced for representing figures. All
positions and sizes are floating point numbers in points.

<DL>
<DT>FIGURE<DD> This element contains all the other elements, as well as
a CAPTION element as first child. It has the attributes WIDTH and HEIGHT.

<DT>RECTANGLE<DD> This element has the attributes
VPOS, HPOS, WIDTH, HEIGHT, PENCOLOR, FILLCOLOR,
DEPTH, PENSTYLE, FILLSTYLE, PENWIDTH, JOIN, CORNERRADIUS.

<DT>CIRCLE<DD> This element has the attributes
VPOS, HPOS, RADIUS, PENCOLOR, FILLCOLOR,
DEPTH, PENSTYLE, FILLSTYLE.

<DT>ELLIPSE<DD>This element has the attributes
VPOS, HPOS, WIDTH, HEIGHT, PENCOLOR, FILLCOLOR,
DEPTH, PENSTYLE, FILLSTYLE, PENWIDTH.

<DT>POLYLINE<DD>This element has the attributes
CLOSED, PENCOLOR, FILLCOLOR,
DEPTH, PENSTYLE, FILLSTYLE, PENWIDTH, CAP, JOIN,
BARROWTYPE, BARROWSIZE, EARROWTYPE, EARROWSIZE, POINTS.

<DT>SPLINE<DD>This element has the attributes
CLOSED, INTERPOLATED, PENCOLOR, FILLCOLOR,

<DT>GTEXT<DD>This element may contain any block level element
(lists, paragraphs...) and has the following attributes
VPOS, HPOS, WIDTH, HEIGHT, DEPTH.

<DT>GGROUP<DD>This element may contain any element acceptable in FIGURE,
except for CAPTION. It has the following attributes: 
VPOS, HPOS, WIDTH,
HEIGHT, DEPTH, TRANSFORM.
</DL>
<P>
Each attribute is detailed below.

<DL>
<DT>ALT<DD> String describing the associated PICTURE, for browsers without
graphics capabilities.

<DT>BARROWSIZE<DD> Three blank separated floating point numbers representing
the arrow thickness, width and height, for the arrow at the beginning of
a polyline, spline, or arc.

<DT>BARROWTYPE<DD> One of TRIANGLE, FTRIANGLE (filled), DIAMOND, FDIAMOND,
  V, HOLLOW, FHOLLOW. It describes the shape of the arrow head, if any, at the
beginning of a polyline, spline or arc.

<DT>CAP<DD>One of BUTT, ROUND, or PROJECTING for the end of a polyline,
  spline, or arc.

<DT>CLOSED<DD>When set to CLOSED, it indicates that the polyline or
  spline is a closed figure (i.e. an edge is added from the last point
  to the first).

<DT>CORNERRADIUS<DD> A floating point number indicating the radius of
  the rounded corners for a rectangle. The default is 0, which corresponds
  to square corners for a rectangle.

<DT>DEPTH<DD> The depth is a cardinal number determining the order in which
  objects are drawn. Objects are drawn in decreasing depth order. Thus,
  deeper objects are hidden behind the others. The depth for a GGROUP
  serves as offset for the whole group.

<DT>EARROWSIZE<DD> Just like BARROWSIZE but for the end arrow.

<DT>EARROWTYPE<DD> Just like BARROWTYPE but for the end arrow.

<DT>FILLCOLOR<DD> Color used to fill the area within graphical objects.
The color may be expressed as three floating point numbers between 0 and 1
representing the red, green and blue intensity, or as a color name.

<DT>FILLSTYLE<DD> The fill style, described by a bitmap (URL), or the name
of a builtin style.

<DT>HEIGHT<DD>Height allowed for the graphical element. It determines the
area available for text objects, twice the vertical radius for
ellipse, the area into which to fit a picture, and the clipping boundary
for group objects.

<DT>HPOS<DD>Horizontal position of the anchor point for the graphical object
(center for circle and ellipse, lower left corner for rectangle, picture,
group, and text objects).

<DT>INTERPOLATED<DD>When set to interpolated, the spline passes through all
the control points.

<DT>JOIN<DD>One of MITER, ROUND, BEVEL.

<DT>P1<DD>Start point (x y) for an arc.

<DT>P2<DD>Point on the arc, somewhere between P1 and P3.

<DT>P3<DD>End point for an arc.

<DT>PENCOLOR<DD>Color for the outline of graphics shapes. It may be expressed
as red, green, and blue intensities (in the [0,1] interval), or as a color 
name.

<DT>PENSTYLE<DD>Blank separated list of floating point numbers, the first
  being the offset within the dash pattern, and the following numbers
  representing the length of solid line and space, in alternation, within
  the pattern.

<DT>PENWIDTH<DD>Width of the outline for graphics shapes.

<DT>PIE<DD>When set to PIE, an arc is closed in a pie shape.

<DT>POINTS<DD>List of blank separated x y floating point coordinates for 
polylines and splines.

<DT>RADIUS<DD>Floating point number for the radius of circles.

<DT>SRC<DD>URL for PICTURE elements.

<DT>TRANSFORM<DD>Six blank separated floating point numbers representing
  the transformation matrix to apply to graphical objects contained
  within a group. The transformation of text objects may not be properly
  handled on all viewing systems, especially rotations.

<DT>VPOS<DD>Vertical position of the anchor point for the graphical object
(center for circle and ellipse, upper left corner for rectangle, picture,
group, and text objects).

<DT>WIDTH<DD> Width allowed for the graphical element. It determines the
area available for text objects, twice the horizontal radius for
ellipse, the area into which to fit a picture, and the clipping boundary
for group objects.
