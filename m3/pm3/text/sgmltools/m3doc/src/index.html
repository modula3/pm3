<H1>The M3DOC documentation system</H1>

<DIV CLASS=ABSTRACT>
<P>This system organizes the documentation of Modula-3 packages. 
The documentation consists in HTML hypertext files and Modula-3 interfaces
with embedded documentation. From this, a web of HTML files and a printable
linear document are produced and shipped to the installation directory.
</DIV>

<P>
Document formats evolved from early inflexible systems to full programming
languages embedded in a formatting engine (e.g. nroff, TeX). In parallel,
less powerfull but visual incremental word processing formats appeared
(e.g. wordstar, wordperfect, word). The benefits of separating the
information content from the presentation parameters has been recognized
early by several groups, notably publishers. From the same content, several
different formats (TeX, RTF, HTML, ASCII, nroff, man) and presentations 
(book, technical report, two column article...) may be generated automatically.
<P>
This led to more structure
oriented formats like SGML/XML
<A HREF="http://www.sil.org/sgml/sgml.html">[SGML]</A>
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">[XML]</A>, 
and to a certain extent LaTeX
<A REL=BIB.ENTRY HREF="references.html#LaTeX"> [LaTeX] </A>. 
These systems
may require more discipline, and thus took time to become popular.
Their benefits were finally recognized, as illustrated by the widespread
use of HTML
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">[HTML]</A>
and Linuxdoc (both based on SGML), other SGML document types,
and Thot
<A HREF="http://opera.inrialpes.fr/thot/">[Thot]</A>.
<P>
Several existing SGML/XML document type definitions (DTD) target technical
publications, including CALS, DOCBOOK, QUERTZ, LINUXDOC, and HTML. Each
varies in terms of supported features (maths, tables, figures, index,
bibliographic references...), supporting tools, and popularity.
None supports all the above mentioned features; in particular, they all resort
to foreign formats for figures. The most popular document type, HTML,
has numerous supporting tools but lacks several features including
maths, figures, index and bibliographic references. However, HTML is 
progressing in several ways and drafts for Math support as well as for
generic extensions have been introduced.

<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>sgml</SPAN></SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS=INDEX.MARK><SPAN CLASS=INDEX.KEY>xml</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
Because of its widespread use, HTML was selected, with a number of extensions
to cover the missing features. These extensions may be expressed using the
generic DIV and SPAN tags for the most part; new elements are introduced for
figures. The resulting DTD is HTML 4.0, plus 
MathHTML 97-07-10, minus
the interactive features (forms, scripts, applets), plus a number of additions
detailed in this document.
<P>
For writing and browsing purposes, it is useful to decompose a long
technical reference manual into several small documents. 
Some of these small documents may be used in several contexts (as a section in
a reference manual, as a subsection in a textbook, as a node in an hypertext
web...). Furthermore, some portions of a reference manual may be generated 
automatically, for instance extracted from program interfaces. 
While most systems like Linuxdoc and
LaTeXtoHTML do split up a large document into small html files, it may be
more natural to assemble a large document from several small ones.
<P>
In the context of documenting Modula-3 programs and libraries, HTML files
are combined, through hypertext links, with commented interface files (.i3).
All the needed HTML and interface files reside in the src directory.
From these, online (web of HTML files) and printed (Postscript)
documentation is generated. For this purpose, Modula-3 interface files
(.i3) are converted to HTML, and hypertext links to the interfaces
are converted appropriately. To generate the printed documentation,
some of the hypertext links are followed in a depth first search, starting
from a root HTML file and including the content of referenced files, 
producing a large linearized HTML document. The linearized HTML document
may then be converted to various formats, including LaTeX and Postscript.

<H2>Declaring documentation files in the m3makefile</H2>
<P>
Each Modula-3 interface (or implementation)
containing user documentation is declared using the
<TT>HtmlInterface(x)</TT> or <TT>HtmlGenericInterface(x)</TT> functions
(or <TT>HtmlImplementation(x)</TT> and <TT>HtmlGenericImplementation(x)</TT>). 
File <TT>x.i3</TT>, or <TT>x.ig</TT>, is converted to HTML using
<TT>m3tosgml -html</TT>, to be exported to the Modula-3 HTML installation
directory. The conventions for embedding the documentation in the
interface comments are detailed later in this document.
<P>
Each HTML file is declared using the <TT>HtmlFile(x)</TT> function. File 
<TT>x.html</TT> is filtered to redirect references to <TT>.i3</TT> files to the
corresponding <TT>.html</TT> files, and to remove any non standard 
HTML extension used.
<P>
Finally, one or more printed documents may be produced by declaring their
root node with the <TT>HtmlRoot(x)</TT> function. 
File <TT>x.html</TT> is used as a start point
for sgmllinear, producing a single HTML file from <TT>x.html</TT> and the files
referenced through hypertext links. The resulting linearized HTML
file is then converted to LaTeX, formatted with latex and converted to
Postscript, to be exported to the Modula-3 DOC installation directory.

<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<P>
This document presents a simple, structured, standard based, documentation
format. It supports all the common constructs available in traditional
systems such as LaTeX (math, table, bibliography, index) as well as
figures (diagrams). This structured format insures portability,
reusability and easy maintenance/transformation. A large part of documents
(excluding the extensions such as index marks and figures) may be
entered using the widely available HTML editors (emacs HTML mode,
Amaya, Netscape, Word...).
