%
% List of all the packages with detailed packaging information on each.
%
% The arguments for each package are:
%
% - name, package name
% - subdirectory, location of the package within the pm3 tree
% - subtree, subtree within the subdirectory/name. For leaf packages,
%   this is the whole subtree, indicated by the empty string. For internal
%   nodes it usually is "src", (e.g. m3compiler which contains documentation 
%   within src but does not "contain" sub packages such as m3cc, m3front...).
% - bundle, name of user installable package in which this package is bundled.
%   For many packages the name and bundle name are the same. For others,
%   several packages are bundled together (e.g. m3build, m3ship, libm3, m3core
%   are part of pm3-base).
% - type, 1 library, 2 program, 3 other
% - bundleHead, is this package the main one for a bundle?
% - buildPhase, 1 m3cc, 2 packages first built without documentation and
%   then with documentation once the m3doc tools are built, 3 rest of
%   packages.
% - dependency, array of packages on which this one depends
% - buildPlatforms, array of platform names or ALL
% - buildReq, array of features required (e.g. MOTIF, OpenGL)
% - description, a short sentence describing the package
