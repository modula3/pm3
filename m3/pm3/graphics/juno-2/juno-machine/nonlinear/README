/proj/m3/pkg/juno-machine/tests/nonlinear/README

This directory contains a simple program to test Juno's non-linear
solver, namely, the procedure RedundantSolve.P(). See the comments at
the head of the file "src/NonLinearTest.m3" for details on how to run
the program (these comments serve in lieu of a man page). Also see the
file "src/README" for more information.
