/proj/m3/pkg/juno-machine/tests/linear/README

This directory contains a simple program to test Juno's linear solver,
namely, the procedure RedundantLSolve.P(). See the comments at the
head of the file "src/LinearTest.m3" for details on how to run the
program (these comments serve in lieu of a man page). Also see the
file "src/README" for more information.
