DESCRIPTION

  This directory contains programs to test various features of the Juno
  compiler. There is one subdirectory for each test program, and each of these
  subdirectories contains both a "src" and a "mips" subdirectory. See the
  README file in the "src" subdirectory of each program directory for more
  information about how to use that program.

CONTENTS

    lexer/		program to test lexer
    parser/		program to test parser/unparser
    scope/          	program to test JunoScope module
    compiler/		program to test compiler

NOTES

  These tests are incremental; for the most part they build on each other in
  the order in which they are listed. The parser test requires a working lexer.
  The compiler requires a working lexer, parser, and unparser.
