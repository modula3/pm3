This directory contains an experimental implementation of user-defined
fonts in Juno. The experiment worked, but proved to be inefficient,
since the user-defined font data was stored in a global Juno variable,
and every time is was read, it had to be converted from a "JunoValue.T"
to a "RTVal.T". This proved to be too slow. We concluded that
user-defined fonts should be implemented by the "PS" module in
Modula-3.
