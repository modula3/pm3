This directory contains a program for building a pickle of Juno's font
metric data structure. The Adobe ASCII font metric files are bundled
in with the program itself. Since pickles are not (yet) architecture
independent, you have to build a different pickle for each
architecture.

To (re)build the font pickle for a particular architecture, first run
"m3build" to rebuild the font pickling program. Then, "cd" into the
directory for the appropriate architecture and run make(1), or type
"./PklFonts > FontData.pkl". This will create a file named
"FontData.pkl" in that directory.

The Juno resource "m3makefile" contains a line for automatically
including the pickle file from the appropriate directory for the
architecture being built.
