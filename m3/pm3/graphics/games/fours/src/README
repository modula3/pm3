This game maintains a set of score files, {Twos,Threes,Fours,Fives}.scores.
The location of the files is determined when the program is compiled.
To set this location,

      m3build -DSCOREDIR=xyz

where "xyz" is the full path name of the directory.  If you fail to
set the score directory, /tmp or c:\temp is used.
