\section{NAME}
Lectern - viewing documents composed of rasterized images

\section{SYNTAX}
\bf{Lectern [file]}

\section{DESCRIPTION }
\bf{Lectern} is a document viewer.  It is intended to make it easy and
comfortable for you to read text documents, such as technical papers,
on-line.

\bf{Lectern} lets you view documents that are in a proprietary format,
created by the program 
\link{BuildLectern.1.html}{BuildLectern(1)}.  These documents contain
images of each page, at original resolution and at reduced resolutions,
as well as data derived from the document by applying an OCR algorithm.
The page images can be acquired by scanning, or by rasterizing some machine
readable form (e.g., by using a program such as GhostScript - gs(1) - to
render PostScript files into images).  See the 
\link{BuildLectern.1.html}{BuildLectern(1)} man page 
for details on how to construct and modify Lectern documents.

When \bf{Lectern} starts up it creates a single \it{image window} displaying
the first page of the Lectern document whose path is \bf{file} (or an
error message, or the Digital logo if \bf{file} is omitted).

SRC has a substantial shared repository of Lectern documents.  The repository
can be browsed hierarchically, or through a full text index.  See the
\link{../home.html}{Virtual Paper home page} to get started.

You can use the programs 
\link{LecternToHTML.1.html}{LecternToHTML(1)} and 
\link{BuildLecternIndex.1.html}{BuildLecternIndex(1)} to build
such repositories.  

\section{USER INTERFACE GENERALITIES}
You can choose whether to drive \bf{Lectern}'s user interface primarily with a
mouse or from your keyboard.  You can discover all of Lectern's commands
using your mouse and the pull-down menu: click the down-arrow at the top
left corner of the image window to see the menu, or just type \tt{m}. The menu
goes away whenever you execute a command, or when you click the up-arrow at
its top left, or when you type \tt{m} once more.

If you are using the mouse as your primary tool, you will want to make
the toolbar visible.  Type \tt{t} or click \bf{Show or Hide Toolbar}
on the menu.  The commands on the toolbar are shortcuts for things you
could have done from the pull-down menu.  The \bf{+} and ``pencil''
buttons in the link browsers (described below) are also designed to
assist those whose are using a mouse.  In the toolbar sub-window, the
\bf{+/- 1/5/20} buttons (for moving 1, 5, or 20 pages at a time),
activate on a down-click, and auto-repeat if you keep the mouse button
held down.

If you are using your keyboard as your primary tool, you might still want to
look at the menu as documentation: it describes all the keyboard shortcuts.
Just type \bf{m} to see the menu, then type the keyboard shortcut for the
command you want (or \bf{m} again) and the menu will go away.

The command descriptions below are given in terms of the keyboard shortcuts,
with the equivalent menu commands in parentheses.

Some Lectern commands produce pop-up dialogs.  In general, you
can cancel or close any dialog by typing \bf{[escape]} or by clicking
the up-arrow in the corner of the dialog; some also have a \bf{Cancel}
button.  In general, one button in the dialog has a black outline;
typing \bf{[return]} is equivalent to clicking that button.

Issuing any command implicitly closes the error dialog, the About Lectern
dialog, and the menu.  Any command other than one of the \bf{Find} commands
closes the Find dialog.

Some of the pop-up dialogs have type-in boxes.  You can edit text in these
using keyboard commands as specified for the FormsVBT library: see the
FormsVBT Reference Manual.  By default these commands are similar to simple
Emacs commands.  You can also copy text into (or out of) them using these
commands.

\bf{Lectern} refers to the images in the document by page number, as far as
possible.  The document's creator should have specified which page should
be treated as page 1, in a way that corresponds to the page numbers printed
on the pages and used in tables of contents or indexes.  \bf{Lectern} refers to
images prior to page 1 by image numbers, counting the first image in the
document as image 1.  The menu anchor shows the current page number, 
or the current image number when you are positioned before page 1.  
The menu itself always shows the current image number, and the page number 
when it is defined.

\section{FILES AND PRINTING}

This section describes explicit commands for controlling
\bf{Lectern}'s access to files.  The \link{#links}{\it{link}}
mechanism provides other ways to open files.  As mentioned earlier,
you can also use \link{LecternClient.1.html}{LecternClient(1)}, and
you can access Lectern documents through Mosaic and the WWW.

You can type \bf{o (Open Document)} to open further \bf{Lectern}
documents, either in separate windows (click \bf{New} in the \bf{Open}
dialog) or replacing the document in the current window (click
\bf{Here} in the \bf{Open} dialog, or type \bf{[return]}).

You can close an image window at any time using the facilities of
your window manager or by typing \bf{w (Close Viewer)}.  If you used the 
\link{#links}{links mechanism} to modify the document and you haven't saved it,
you will be asked to confirm that you really want to discard your
modifications.

When you close the last image window, \bf{Lectern} quits. Typing \bf{q (Quit)} is
equivalent to closing each image window in turn.

Type \bf{p} (Print) to send the images (or original PostScript) to
the printer, or to save images as EPSF or PostScript job files.  Note that
printing rasterized 300 DPI images is quite slow -
multiple minutes per page on typical printers.  It would be even slower for
grayscale or color images, except that printing them isn't implemented yet.
Printing the original PostScript (if it's available) proceeds at the original
rate.

\section{SELECTIONS}
You can select text in the image window by clicking (once) with the left mouse
button.  You can extend the selection by dragging, or by right-clicking,
or by shift-clicking.  A selection can extend over multiple pages.
When you have selected text, it is available in
character form as the X-11 ``source selection''.  For example, you can
paste it into an xterm by middle-clicking there.  The characters you get,
and the order of the words in an extended selection, are those provided
by the OCR algorithm that was applied to the images by 
\link{BuildLectern.1.html}{BuildLectern(1)}.

If you double-click with the left mouse button on a word, \bf{Lectern} will
select that word then try to find the next occurrence of the word in the
document, as if you had typed \bf{f (Find)}, followed by the word, followed
by \bf{[return] (Find Next)}.

If you double-click with the middle mouse button on a word that is an integer,
\bf{Lectern} will select that word and move to that page of the document, as if
you had typed the number followed by \bf{[return] (To Page)}.

\section{NAVIGATING}
This section describes \bf{Lectern}'s basic navigation commands.  The 
\link{#links}{\it{link}} and
\link{#thumbnails}{\it{thumbnail}}
mechanisms (described later) provide further navigation tools.

Type \bf{[space] (Go Forward)} to move forward in the document and
\bf{[backspace] (Go Backward)} to move backward.  See the section on
\link{#viewControls}{View-Area and Viewing Controls} for a more precise
description.  You can equivalently use the cursor or arrow keys on
your keyboard: up or left means \bf{Go Backward}, down or right means \bf{Go
Forward}.

Use \bf{+ (Next Page)} to move to the next page.  Use \bf{- (Previous Page)} to
move to the previous page.  \bf{b (Beginning Page)} moves to the beginning of the
document.  \bf{c (Contents Page)} moves to the first contents page, if the
document has a known contents page. \bf{i (Index Page)} moves to the first index
page, similarly.  The function key \bf{next} or \bf{page down} is equivalent to \bf{+},
as is \bf{=}; the function key \bf{prior} or \bf{page up} is equivalent to \bf{-}.  The
function key \bf{end} moves to the end of the document.

Type \bf{h (Home)}, or use the \bf{home} function key, to move to the page containing
the selection (or the beginning of the document if there is no selection).

Typing any digit \bf{0} through \bf{9} brings up the \bf{go} dialog, with its type-in
initialized to the digit.  Finish typing a number, then type \bf{[return] (To Page)}
to go to that page.  Or type \bf{+ (Fwd)} to go forward that number of pages,
or \bf{- (Back)} to go back that number of pages.  For example, if you're on
page 34, type \bf{7[return]} to go to page 7, or \bf{7+} to go to page 41, or \bf{7-}
to go to page 27.  The meaning of page 1 was defined by the
document's creator, so as to correspond to the page numbers in the
document: it's likely not to be the first image in the document.
Images before page 1 have no page numbers; you can get to them only by relative
positioning, or commands such as \bf{b (Beginning Page)} and \bf{c (Contents Page)}.

As described above, middle-double-click on a number is a shortcut for typing
\bf{number [return]}, i.e., it goes to the numbered page, provided the document's
creator correctly specified the location of page 1.

Type \bf{f (Find)} to pop-up the Find dialog.  Also, if the selection is not on
the current page, this command sets an empty selection at the start of the
current page.  (If you don't want that, type \bf{h (Home)} first.)  In the
Find dialog you can type a search target (currently only a single word), then
click \bf{First}, \bf{Next} or \bf{Prev} to find the first, next, or previous
occurrence of that word in this document, starting at the beginning of the
selection.  You can type \bf{[return]} as a shortcut for \bf{Next}.  After the
search, keystrokes are interpreted as commands (any of which will implicitly
close the Find dialog).  But while the Find dialog remains visible, you can
continue typing [return] to find the next occurrence of the search target. 
Type \bf{[escape]} to close the Find dialog explicitly.

As described above, left-double-click on a word is a shortcut for typing
\bf{f word [return]}, i.e., it finds the next occurrence in this document.
 
Type \bf{u (Undo Page Change)} to undo the most recent operation that moved to
a different page or to a different resolution (\bf{<} or \bf{>}, described
below).  You can repeatedly type \bf{u} to move backwards in history, until
you reach the point where you opened this window.  This includes moving back across places where you opened a new document into an existing window.  Type \bf{r (Redo Page
Change)} to redo, i.e., to undo an undo command (if you haven't moved to
another page or resolution in between).

If you hold down the middle mouse button (or control-left) in the
image window, you can drag the image around.  The effect of this
dragging is transient - it is ignored the next time you issue a
command that moves around the page or moves to another page.  See also
the description of the \link{#viewControls}{View-Area and Viewing
Controls}, which provide a more persistent way of altering the part of
the image that is visible.

\section{\anchor{links}{LINKS AND THUMBNAILS}}

Links and thumbnails provide a mechanism that lets you jump to a 
particular page of a particular document with a single click.  If the link
specifies a different document, jumping implicitly opens the document. 
Jumping can also select some text starting on the specified page.

\bf{Lectern} supports three types of links:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \it{Bookmark} links are personal and transient, intended for keeping 
track of places in the short term.  Think of bookmarks as being 
like keeping your place by sticking a finger between the pages 
of a document.  You can have at most 10 bookmarks (no, you can't 
use your toes).  When an eleventh bookmark is created, the first 
bookmark is deleted.  This is the essence of bookmarks' transience:  
you (and \bf{Lectern}) can create them casually, without cluttering 
up your workspace, because excess bookmarks are deleted automatically.  
If you want to keep a bookmark, use \bf{e (Edit Links)} to convert 
it into a diary entry, as described below.  Your bookmarks are 
preserved in a file in your home directory ($HOME), so they aren't 
lost when you quit \bf{Lectern}.  Indeed, when you restart \bf{Lectern} 
your last bookmark will describe the last place you were before 
you quitted \bf{Lectern}. 

\item \it{Diary} links are personal and persistent.  Think of them as 
your personal notebook of favorite documents and places.  Diary 
links belong to a single user; they are preserved in a file in 
your home directory ($HOME).  It's entirely up to you to create, 
sort and delete them. 
  
\item \it{Outline} links are attached to a particular document, and are 
stored within the document.  They are a way for the document 
designer to help you to navigate around the document, or to jump 
to somewhere in a related document.  Unlike hypertext links (not 
yet available in Lectern), all of a document's outline links are 
available whenever you're viewing the document, independently 
of your current position within the document.
\end{enumerate}

\anchor{thumbnails}{\it{Thumbnails}} are stored with a document, and are
generated automatically by 
\link{BuildLectern.1.html}{BuildLectern}(1)}.  They provide a
visual way to find a page within that document.

Bookmarks, diaries and outlines are all essentially the same mechanism.  
They differ in how or when they are created, accessed and deleted, 
and how and where they are stored.  But each of them is just a way 
of remembering a particular place in a particular document (not necessarily 
the current document). 

Bookmarks, diary links and outline links are identified by text strings.  
Thumbnails are identified by 1/16 scale images of their pages.

To create a link of any type, first go to the place that you want the 
link to jump to. Then either type \bf{n (New Bookmark)} to create a bookmark, or click the \bf{+} button in one of the link browsers to create a link of the corrseponding type.  Lectern chooses a name for the link and creates it. 

Whenever you stop viewing a document (by closing a viewer, by terminating 
\bf{Lectern}, or by opening a new document in an existing viewer), \bf{Lectern} creates a bookmark link describing the place that you just left. 

Creating an eleventh bookmark link implicitly deletes the first bookmark link. 

A newly created link is placed at the bottom of its class.  You can 
use \bf{e (Edit Links)} to promote it or to rename it, or to convert it to another type of link, as described below. 

The simplest way to jump to a link or thumbnail is to type \bf{L (Show 
or Hide Link Browsers)}, so that the link browsers are visible in your 
image window, then click once on one of the links or thumbnails. If you left-click, the link's destination is loaded into the current window; right-click or shift-left-click to load it into a new window.

If you prefer to use the keyboard to jump to a link, type \bf{j (Jump 
to Link)}.  In the popup-up dialog, select the type of link you're 
interested in (by default you see the bookmarks).  You can do this 
by clicking one of the radio buttons, or by using the right-arrow 
and left-arrow cursor keys on your keyboard.  Then select the link: 
type the initial part of the its name (until the appropriate link 
is selected); or select it manually in the dialog using the mouse; 
or select it using the down-arrow and up-arrow cursor keys on your 
keyboard.  Or use a combination of all of these methods.  Then type 
\bf{[return] (Jump)} to jump to it. 

You can use \bf{e (Edit Links)} to modify the existing sets of links.  
(You can't modify the thumbnails.)  In the Edit Links dialog you 
can select a link in the usual ways.  You can use the \bf{(Up)} and \bf{(Down)} 
buttons to change the order of the links.  You can convert a link 
from one type to another.  Or you can rename a link.  You can do 
these operations for several links in a single use of the dialog. 

You can also edit links by clicking the ``pencil'' button at the top 
of one of the links browsers, when they are visible.

Changes you make to your diary or to the set of bookmarks are saved 
when you close the New Link or Edit Links dialog. 

You can save changes that you make to a document's outline with the 
\bf{s (Save Document)} command.

Your bookmarks and diary are shared across simultaneously executing
Lecterns, provided they access the same "$HOME".  When one
\bf{Lectern} saves changes to your diary or bookmarks, any other copy
of \bf{Lectern} notices the changes in about 10 seconds, and updates
its viewers appropriately.

You can access someone else's bookmarks or diary from within \bf{Lectern} 
by opening their $HOME/.bookmarks.lect or $HOME/.diary.lect as an 
ordinary \bf{Lectern} document: their bookmarks or diary will appear as 
the outline of that document. 

\section{WINDOWS AND SETTINGS}
Type \bf{m (Menu Buttons)} to pull down or release the menu.  Type \bf{k
(Menu Anchor)} to show or hide the menu anchor button. Type \bf{v (Viewing
Controls)} to show or hide the viewing controls window (described below). 
Type \bf{t (Thumbnail Window)} to show or hide the thumbnail window (described
earlier).  Type [return] to confirm an operation in a modal dialog, or
to close the \bf{About Lectern} window.  Type \bf{[escape]} to cancel or close a
dialog.

You can zoom an image window by typing \bf{z (Zoom)} (and again to unzoom it). 
When you do this, \bf{Lectern} tries to make the image window occupy the entire
screen.  This is especially effective if you use \bf{Lectern} for presentations.
And you can use the \bf{k (Menu Anchor)} command to hide the menu anchor button,
leaving your entire screen filled with just the images.

By default \bf{Lectern} shows the images scaled to 100 dots per inch (DPI) (if the
originals were 300 DPI).  This makes the image look life size or somewhat
larger on your screen, depending on the actual resolution of your monitor. 
Type \bf{> (Larger Images)} to move to a finer resolution (magnifying the image), 
or \bf{< (Smaller Images)} to move to a coarser resolution (shrinking the
image). Typing \bf{,} or \bf{.} is equivalent to \bf{<} or \bf{>}.  The available
resolutions are 75, 100, 150 DPI (or more accurately, scale factors
of 4, 3, and 2 from the original images).  Most current monitors are
75 to 100 DPI.

\section{\anchor{viewControls}{VIEW-AREA AND VIEWING CONTROLS}}

The \it{view-area} is a rectangle specifying what part of the current 
page image you would like to be able to view.  By default, \bf{Lectern} 
calculates this for you automatically whenever you move to a new 
page, and by default the \bf{[space] (Go Forward)} command traverses through 
the view-area of the current page in vertical strips, starting at 
its top-left corner.  When you reach the bottom right, \bf{[space] (Go 
Forward)} moves you to the next page.  The \bf{[backspace] (Go Backward)} 
command works similarly in the opposite direction. 

This process works well if the automatic calculation corresponds 
to the part of the page you actually want to view, and if the page 
is set in either one or two columns, and if each column is no wider 
than the window.  In other situations, you might need to intervene.  
On occasion, the best fix is to change the width of the \bf{Lectern} viewer 
window.  The rest of the time you'll need to use the viewing controls 
sub-window.  Type \bf{v (Viewing Controls)} to show or hide 
the viewing controls sub-window. 

If \bf{Lectern}'s automatic calculation of the view-area is wrong, use 
your mouse to adjust the view area rectangle's corners in the viewing 
controls sub-window.  Doing so flips the radio button below the thumbnail 
from \bf{automatic} to \bf{manual}.  Your choice of rectangle persists from 
page to page, until you choose a different rectangle, or click the 
\bf{automatic} radio button or type \bf{a (Automatic View Area)}, which 
switches back to having Lectern calculate the view-area for you on 
each page.

If traversing the view-area by vertical strips isn't appropriate, 
click one of the other radio buttons in the viewing controls sub-window.  
Using horizontal strips is good for some pages laid out as tables.  
Using a single strip down the center of the page is good if you want 
to ignore marginal labels or notes.  Using "to the next page" is 
good for concentrating on the center of the view area, ignoring intrusive 
marginal notes, headers and footers.  I've never used a single strip 
across the page, but it completes the set.  Note that if the entire 
view-area fits into the window, all the choices here are equivalent.  
Your choice of traversal method persists from page to page, until 
you change it. 

\section{LecternClient}

You can also create a viewer on a Lectern document with the
\bf{LecternClient} program.  \bf{LecternClient} will communicate with
an existing instance of the \bf{Lectern} program, or if necessary will
start \bf{Lectern} for you.  See the
\link{LecternClient.1.html}{LecternClient(1)} man page for details.

Using \bf{LecternClient} causes \bf{Lectern} to load a document into the image window
labelled as \it{server}.  The first image window is the initial \it{server}.  You
can type \bf{d} to detach an image window, so that it is no longer the server. 
In this situation, or if you close the server window, the next LecternClient
request will create a new image window as the server window.

\bf{LecternClient} can have one or two integer arguments following the document's
file title.  If the first integer argument is present, it is interpreted by
\bf{Lectern} as a word number; the second is a word count.  If they are present,
these arguments cause \bf{Lectern} to select a range of words in the document
(counting from 0), and to position the opened document to the page containing
the start of that selection.
