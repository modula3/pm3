<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This program sends a message to the latest instance of Lectern that was
started by the current user on the current machine.  If it can't contact an
instance of Lectern, it attempts to start another one.<P>

See
<A HREF="Lectern.1.html">Lectern(1)</A>
for the interpretation of the arguments.  When LecternClient is called with a
single pathname, it is made absolute if necessary (by prefixing it with the
pathname of the current working directory) and passed to Lectern. When
LecternClient is called with the <B>-f</B> option, its single argument is interpreted
as the name of a file containing one or more lines, each of which is passed
unchanged to Lectern. When LecternClient is called with the <B>-l</B> option, its
remaining arguments are passed uninterpreted to Lectern.
