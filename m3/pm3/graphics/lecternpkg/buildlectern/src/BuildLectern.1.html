<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This program constructs in the file named <B>dest</B> a Lectern document composed
of page images, attributes and other data, suitable for viewing with
<A HREF="Lectern.1.html">Lectern(1)</A>,
and suitable for indexing with 
<A HREF="BuildLecternIndex.1.html">BuildLecternIndex(1)</A>.
The page images
come from files each containing a single image, or from a file containing a
PostScript job, or from pre-existing Lectern documents.  The resulting
documents include computed copies of the images at reduced scales, and derived
OCR data.<P>

Note: the arguments to BuildLectern are processed sequentially (as
described below): an argument such as <A HREF="#-PScolor"><B>-PScolor</B></A>
affects only input files later in the argument list.<P>

Caution: it is surprisingly easy to forget the <B>dest</B> argument, and
this can cause BuildLectern to think that the name of your last input
file is the intended destination, and so to write the output there.<P>

The program constructs the document in a temporary file in the same
directory as the final destination; on success the temporary file is
renamed as the destination, and on failure the temporary file is
deleted.  So it is acceptable to use this program to modify a file
in-place by naming the same destination file in an
<A HREF="#-images"><B>-images</B></A>,
<A HREF="#-include"><B>-include</B></A> or
<A HREF="#-rescale"><B>-rescale</B></A>
option.<P>

Uncolored Lectern documents generally occupy about 100 KBytes per
page, if you use the <A HREF="#-noUnscaled"><B>-noUnscaled</B></A> option.
The unscaled images (not normally included for PostScript jobs) add
about 100 KBytes per page, and color roughly doubles the size.  If you
use the <A HREF="#-only"><B>-only 3</B></A> option, the size is reduced to
about 35 KBytes per page.<P>

This program constructs various temporary files in the same directory as the
final destination file.  These include a temporary copy of the output, and a
temporary copy of one image if the image is color or in TIFF format or comes
from standard input or PostScript.  The temporary output file is the same size
as the final output, and the temporary image copy can be up to 32 MBytes (for
300 DPI 24-bit color plus the corresponding black and white).  You need to
have this much disk space available!<P>

For the purposes of describing the behavior of this program, the
images within a Lectern document should be viewed as being numbered
sequentially from 1, regardless of the user's notion of how pages are
numbered.  The <A HREF="#-page1"><B>-page1</B></A> option allows you to
specify the user's notion of page numbering, but does not affect the
<I>image numbers</I> considered by this program.  (Programmers should
note that the internal format of a Lectern document uses yet another
numbering system for pages, starting from 0; but that need not concern
users of this program.)<P>

The program constructs the document by processing its arguments
sequentially.  While doing so, it maintains a <I>current image
number</I> (initially 1), a <I>mode</I> (initially <I>simplex</I>), a
<I>current gamma value</I> (initially 1.0), a <I>current resolution</I> (initially
300 DPI), a flag indicating whether to include the unscaled images in
the output file (initially set), and an <A HREF="#-realOCR"><I>OCR
flag</I></A> (initially <I>clear</I> unless BuildLectern was linked with an
OCR library, in which case it is <I>real</I>).  The destination document
initially has no images, no attributes and no
<A HREF="#-original"><I>original</I></A>; its <A HREF="#-contents"><I>contents</I></A>
is 0 (meaning <I>undefined</I>), its <A HREF="#-page1"><I>page1</I></A> is 1
(meaning the first image), and its <A HREF="#-index"><I>index</I></A> is 0
(meaning <I>undefined</I>).<P>

If an argument is not one of the options described below, it should be
a file's pathname.  The named file should contain either the image of
a single page at the current resolution, in PBM, PGM, PPM, or TIFF
format, a Lectern file, or a PostScript job.  It is also possible to
read a PostScript job from standard input, by specifying - as the file
name on the command line.<P>

When the program encounters an image file, it copies the image into
the document at the current image number, and updates the current
image number: if the mode is <A HREF="#-simplex"><I>simplex</I></A> it adds 1,
if the mode is <A HREF="#-recto"><I>recto</I></A> it adds 2 and if the mode is
<A HREF="#-verso"><I>verso</I></A> it subtracts 2 (subject to a minimum of 1).
While copying the image, the program creates copies of the image at
reduced scales (using the current gamma value), and applies an OCR
algorithm to the image unless the <A HREF="#-noOCR"><I>OCR flag</I></A> is
not real.  The reduced images are scaled down by the integer nearest to
(<A HREF="#-resolution"><I>current resolution</I></A> * <I>n</I> / 300),
for <I>n</I> equal to 2, 3, and 4 (but see <A HREF="#-only"><B>-only</B></A>).
The original image is copied to the output only if the
<A HREF="#-includeUnscaled"><I>include unscaled flag</I></A> is set.  Note the
<A HREF="#-stdin"><B>-stdin</B></A> option, which provides an alternative way
to process a sequence of images without keeping them all in files.<P>

When the program encounters a Lectern file, its contents are included as if
<B>-include file 1 999999</B> had been specified.<P>

When the program encounters a PostScript job, the Ghostscript
interpreter is run to produce a sequence of images and OCR data (if
the <A HREF="#-noOCR"><I>OCR flag</I></A> is not cleared), which are copied
into the document in the normal way.  While processing a PostScript
job, the program consults these additional variables: an image type
(initially <I>black&amp;white</I>), an orientation (initially
<I>portrait</I>), a scale (initially 1.0), and a flag indicating whether
to include the PostScript in the final document (initially set).
Also, different defaults are used for several normal variables:
<A HREF="#-gamma"><I>gamma</I></A> is 0.454, the
<A HREF="#-includeUnscaled"><I>include unscaled flag</I></A> is cleared, and
the <I>OCR flag</I> is <A HREF="#-PSfakeOCR"><I>fake</I></A>.  The image type
enforces an upper bound on the kind of images that will be produced by
the PostScript interpreter, with <I>black&amp;white</I> &lt; <I>grayscale</I> &lt;
<I>color</I>.<P>

Whenever the program is placing a color image into <B>dest</B>, it reduces the
set of colors in the image to a small set, chosen from a 4 by 4 by 4 color
cube (i.e., 64 colors), so that the image will be suitable for color
mapped monitors.  Similarly, it reduces the set of grays in a grayscale
image to 16 gray levels.  Note that this means that any subsequent
rescaling or other image processing will be based on an image from which
information has been lost, so the image quality might then suffer.  There
is no loss of information for black-and-white images.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>EXAMPLES</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The simplest use is to invoke the program with a PostScript job constituting
the entire document.<P>

This will construct in <B>dest</B> a Lectern document consisting of the pages
produced by the PostScript job, each scaled to the various resolutions, with
no imaging adjustments and no attributes.  When you view such a document with
Lectern, the pages will be numbered from 1 and the <B>Contents</B> and <B>Index</B>
commands will not work.  For example:
<PRE>
   BuildLectern a.ps a.lect
</PRE>

You can assemble a document from several PostScript files:
<PRE>
   BuildLectern cover.ps chap1.ps chap2.ps chap3.ps index.ps book.lect
</PRE>

Note that concatenating PostScript files is non-trivial, so
BuildLectern doesn't try; instead it just keeps the first PostScript
file it encounters as the document's <I>original</I>.  In this case, it
may be better to specify <A HREF="#-PSnoOriginal"><B>-PSnoOriginal</B></A>
before the first PostScript argument.<P>

If you have a set of image files resulting from scanning a document, you can
use BuildLectern to build a document from them like this:
<PRE>
   BuildLectern *.tif a.lect
</PRE>

Alternatively, if the document was scanned from two-sided originals you might
use a command line such as the following:
<PRE>
   BuildLectern -recto *.fronts.tif -verso *.backs.tif a.lect
</PRE>

If you just want to preview or display images, and the images were created
at 300 DPI and you want to display at 100 DPI, you could use:
<PRE>
   BuildLectern -only 3 *.pbm a.lect
</PRE>

A third common usage pattern is to construct a new document from
an existing one, adding attributes, specifying the location of contents
and index pages, or modifying the images' gamma adjustments.  You could
do these in a single run of BuildLectern, or incrementally in several
separate runs.  For example:
<PRE>
   BuildLectern a.lect -contents 3 -index 57 b.lect
</PRE>

or, equivalently:
<PRE>
   BuildLectern -include a.lect 1 9999 -contents 3 -index 57 b.lect
</PRE>

or:
<PRE>
   BuildLectern b.lect -author: "Andrew Birrell" c.lect
</PRE>

or:
<PRE>
   BuildLectern -gamma 0.45 -rescale a.lect 1 9999 -index 59 d.lect
</PRE>

There are a few additional options, described below.  You can also use
the options to perform detailed re-arrangements, such as replacing a single
page of a document, or constructing a single document from multiple documents,
or selectively modifying the gamma adjustments of individual pages.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>THE OPTIONS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The complete set of options is as follows.  (BuildLectern ignores case when
checking for options.)<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="-contents"><B>-contents integer</B></A><DD>
Specifies that the image containing the start of the document's 
table of contents is the image numbered <B>integer</B>, counting from 
1 (regardless of the user's notion of page numbering).<P>

<DT><A NAME="-gamma"><B>-gamma number</B></A><DD>
Sets the current gamma value to the given <B>number</B>, which should 
be in the range [0.1 .. 10.0].  The current gamma value affects 
the appearance of the reduced scale images that the program creates.  
Gamma adjustment alters the mid-tones of an image, leaving pure 
white and pure black unchanged.  Gamma values greater 
than 1.0 lighten the image, and values less than 1.0 darken it.  
See also the 
<A HREF="#rescale"><B>-rescale</B></A>
 option, which lets you iterate on the 
choice of gamma values.  The current gamma value has no effect 
on the unscaled images of the document.  On most documents a 
gamma value somewhere in the range 0.4 to 1.0 is satisfactory. <P>

<DT><A NAME="-image"><B>-image integer</B></A><DD>
Sets the current image number to be the given integer (which
must be no less than 1). <P>

<DT><A NAME="-images"><B>-images file from for</B></A><DD>
This option is the same as the <A HREF="#-include"><B>-include</B></A> option,
except that only the images (and their scaled versions and OCR data)
are copied.  None of the source file's attributes and miscellaneous
data (<I>page1</I>, <I>contents</I>, <I>index</I> and <I>original</I> values)
is copied, only the images.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-include"><B>-include file from for</B></A><DD>
Includes the contents of a pre-existing Lectern document residing in
<B>file</B> into the current document, by copying.  All the
miscellaneous data are copied: the <I>page1</I> value, the <I>contents</I>
value, the <I>index</I> value, the <I>original</I>, and the attributes,
unless the corresponding datum is already defined for the destination
document.  (In other words, any miscellaneous data specified by an
explicit command line option, or by an earlier
<A HREF="#-include"><B>-include</B></A> or <A HREF="#rescale"><B>-rescale</B></A> will
dominate data from <B>file</B>).<P>

The images in <B>file</B> starting at the image numbered <B>from</B>
(counting from 1) are copied into the current document starting at the
current image number (even if there is already such an image); after
each image is copied, the current image number is modified in the same
way as it is after processing an image file, with due regard to the
current mode (<A HREF="#recto"><I>recto</I></A>, <A HREF="#verso"><I>verso</I></A>, or
<A HREF="#simplex"><I>simplex</I></A>).  Images are copied until <B>for</B>
images have been copied or until the last image in <B>file</B> has been
copied.  The relevant scaled images and OCR data are copied from
<B>file</B> intact along with the original unscaled images (except that
the unscaled images are omitted if the
<A HREF="#-includeUnscaled"><I>include unscaled flag</I></A> is not currently
set).  See also the <A HREF="#rescale"><B>-rescale</B></A> option, which is
similar, but recreates the scaled images using the current gamma
value; and the <A HREF="#-images"><B>-images</B></A> option, which is similar
but does not copy the miscellaneous data.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-includeUnscaled"><B>-includeUnscaled</B></A><DD>
Sets the <I>include unscaled flag</I>, which controls whether original, unscaled,
images are written to <B>dest</B>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-index"><B>-index integer</B></A><DD>
Specifies that the image containing the start of the document's 
index pages is the image numbered <B>integer</B>, in the user's notion
of page numbering.  For example, if you have used the option
<B>-page1 3</B>, and the document hardcopy has the first index page with
a page number of 17 printed on it, you would say <B>-index 17</B> (in
this example, the index starts on the 20th image, counting from 1).
Note that the meaning of this option is affected by any previous
use of the <B>-page1</B>, 
<A HREF="#-include"><B>-include</B></A>
or
<A HREF="#-rescale"><B>-rescale</B></A>
options.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-key"><B>-key: value</B></A><DD>
For any string <B>key</B>, adds a key-value pair to the document
with the given key and value.  For example, the option
<B>-author: Andrew</B> specifies that the attribute <B>author</B> has the value
<B>Andrew</B>.  Adding an attribute with a given key implicitly removes any
previous attribute with the identical key (case is significant).<P>

<DT><A NAME="-noAttribute"><B>-noAttribute key</B></A><DD>
If there is an attribute in the document with a key identical 
to <B>key</B> (case is significant), remove it.  This is useful primarily 
to remove attributes that were copied in by using the
<A HREF="#-include"><B>-include</B></A>
option. <P>

<DT><A NAME="-noOCR"><B>-noOCR</B></A><DD>
Clears the <I>OCR flag</I>, thus preventing any OCR data from being
generated (either by running the <A HREF="#-realOCR"><I>real</I></A> OCR
algorithm or by doing <A HREF="#-PSfakeOCR"><I>fake</I></A> OCR as part of
interpreting PostScript) for subsequent images.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-noUnscaled"><B>-noUnscaled</B></A><DD>
Clears the <I>include unscaled flag</I>, which controls whether original,
unscaled, images are written to <B>dest</B>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-only"><B>-only n</B></A><DD>
For subsequent pages, BuildLectern will compute only one version of
the image, being the original image scaled down by a factor of <B>n</B>.
(By default, BuildLectern includes three versions: the original image
scaled down by factors of 4, 3, and 2.)  With this option, OCR
processing is disabled.  This option also affects images processed by
the
<A HREF="#-rescale"><B>-rescale</B></A>
option, but not those copied by the 
<A HREF="#-include"><B>-include</B></A>
or 
<A HREF="#-images"><B>-images</B></A>,
options. The purpose of this option is to permit fast document
construction when only one scale and no OCR is needed, for example to
proof PostScript files or to present slides.  If both <B>-only</B> and
<A HREF="#-resolution"><B>-resolution</B></A> are used, <B>-only</B> must come
first, since <B>-resolution</B> alters the exact scale values used.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-original"><B>-original file</B></A><DD>
Copy the contents of <B>file</B> into the document as the document's 
<I>original</I>.  This is intended to be the PostScript that was used 
to create the document, and if it is available it will be used 
by 
<A HREF="Lectern.1.html">Lectern(1)</A>,
for printing the document, in preference to printing 
the images themselves.  (Potentially it could also be used to 
generate images at other resolutions, but certainly not today 
and probably never.) <P>

<DT><A NAME="-page1"><B>-page1 integer</B></A><DD>
Specifies that the image which the user thinks of as the document's 
page 1 (i.e. the image whose hardcopy page has the digit "1" printed
on it) is the image numbered <B>integer</B>, counting from 1.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-PSblackAndWhite"><B>-PSblackAndWhite</B></A><DD>
Sets the image type used for processing a PostScript job to black&amp;white.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-PScolor"><B>-PScolor</B></A><DD>
Sets the image type used for processing a PostScript job to color.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-PSfakeOCR"><B>-PSfakeOCR</B></A><DD>
Sets the <I>OCR flag</I> to <I>fake</I>, which means that when PostScript is being
interpreted, OCR data will be derived as a side-effect, rather than by running
the actual OCR algorithm.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-PSgray"><B>-PSgray</B></A><DD>
Sets the image type used for processing a PostScript job to grayscale.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-PSgs"><B>-PSgs</B></A><DD>
Specifies the pathname of the Ghostscript executable (by default, <I>gs</I>).<P>

<DT><A NAME="-PSincludeOriginal"><B>-PSincludeOriginal</B></A><P>

<DD>Sets the <I>include original flag</I>, which controls whether a PostScript
job is included as the <I>original</I> in <B>dest</B>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-PSlandscape"><B>-PSlandscape</B></A><DD>
Sets the orientation to <I>landscape</I>, which causes output from a
PostScript job to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  If this results in
upside-down images, use <B>-PSlandscapeOther</B> instead.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-PSlandscapeOther"><B>-PSlandscapeOther</B></A><DD>
Sets the orientation to <I>upside-down landscape</I>, which causes output from a
PostScript job to be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  If this results in
upside-down images, use <B>-PSlandscape</B> instead.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-PSportrait"><B>-PSportrait</B></A><DD>
Sets the orientation <I>portrait</I>, which causes output from a PostScript job to
be used as-is.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-PSnoOriginal"><B>-PSnoOriginal</B></A><DD>
Clears the <I>include original flag</I>, which controls whether a PostScript job is
included as the <I>original</I> in dest.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-PSscale"><B>-PSscale number</B></A><DD>
Sets the scale factor to <B>number</B>, which causes PostScript jobs to
generate images of <B>number</B>*300DPI (which are then reduced in the
normal way).  For example, <B>-PSScale 1.1</B> increases the final image size by 10%.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-realOCR"><B>-realOCR</B></A><DD>
Sets the <I>OCR flag</I> to <I>real</I>, which causes OCR data for
subsequent images to be acquired by running the OCR algorithm (even
when processing PostScript files).<P>

<DT><A NAME="-recto"><B>-recto</B></A><DD>
Sets the mode to <I>recto</I>.  In this mode the current image number 
increases by 2 after processing an image file or while processing 
an <A HREF="#-include"><B>-include</B></A>
option.  The expectation is that while in <I>recto</I> 
mode the program will be processing the recto (odd-numbered or 
front) pages of the document, in ascending order, and that <I>recto</I> 
mode will be followed by an equal number of images in <I>verso</I> 
mode. <P>

<DT><A NAME="-resolution"><B>-resolution integer</B></A><DD>
Sets the current resolution of image files (PNM and TIFF) to
<B>integer</B> instead of the default, 300 DPI.  If both
<A HREF="#-only"><B>-only</B></A> and <B>-resolution</B> are used, <B>-only</B>
must come first, since <B>-resolution</B> alters the exact scale values
used.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-rescale"><B>-rescale file from for</B></A><DD>
This option is the same as the 
<A HREF="#-include"><B>-include</B></A> option, except that 
while copying images from <B>file</B>, the existing scaled images 
are discarded and replaced by new ones created with the current 
gamma value.  This allows you to iterate on the gamma value for 
a document, or for particular images in a document. <P>

<DT><A NAME="-simplex"><B>-simplex</B></A><DD>
Sets the mode to <I>simplex</I>.  In this mode the current image number 
increases by 1 after processing an image file or while processing 
an <A HREF="#-include"><B>-include</B></A> option.  This contrasts with 
<A HREF="#-recto"><I>recto</I></A> and 
<A HREF="#-verso"><I>verso</I></A> 
modes. <P>

<DT><A NAME="-stdin"><B>-stdin</B></A><DD>
Processes a sequence of images from standard input, as if the images
had been presented in separate files. The images should be in PPM, PGM or PBM
raw (binary) format, and should appear sequentially on standard input,
optionally separated by white space. The sequence is terminated by end of
file on standard input.  Note that TIFF images and non-raw PNM images are
not yet supported in this option. This option
is intended primarily for passing images produced by gs(1)
into BuildLectern through a pipe. This avoids the use of a large amount
of temporary disk storage for the complete set of images, since this
option keeps only one image on disk at a time. Note that you can't just pipe
the standard output of gs(1) into BuildLectern, since gs writes status messages
on its standard output. Instead, give gs(1) an option such as
<PRE>
   "-sOutputFile=|BuildLectern foo.lect -stdin"
</PRE>

including the quotes.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-verbose"><B>-verbose</B></A><DD>
Writes details of the image scaling and OCR operations to the standard
error stream.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-verso"><B>-verso</B></A><DD>
Sets the mode to <I>verso</I> and immediately subtracts 1 from the current image
number (recall that the current image number will have been increased by 2
after processing the final <I>recto</I> image).  In this mode the current image
number decreases by 2 after processing an image file or while processing an
<A HREF="#-include"><B>-include</B></A> option.  You will get an error message if this process would result in
an image having a number less than 1.  The expectation is that
<I>verso</I> mode will be set immediately after <I>recto</I> mode, and
that while in <I>verso</I> mode the program will be processing the verso
(even-numbered or back) pages of the document, in descending order.
