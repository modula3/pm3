<P>
 This is the ``menu-style'' equivalent of PageButton.
It switches to the next or previous child of a TSplit. 
Its target is a TSplit, which may be specified by the <TT>For</TT> property; 
otherwise the target the nearest TSplit ancestor of the PageMButton itself.

      TSplit.
      
<DT>Back<DD> (Boolean, <TT>FALSE</TT>) <BR> If true, the button advances backward 
      among children of the TSplit, otherwise it advances forward.

<DT><B>Behavior</B><DD> PageMButton is like an MButton, but before generating an event,
it switches the children of a TSplit.  However, if the TSplit
is not Circular, and if the last (first) child is already being
displayed, nothing happens and no event is generated.
    
<DT><B>Shape</B><DD> The natural shape of its child (i.e., with no shrink
or stretch), plus the border around the button.
