This is a reference manual for Trestle, a Modula-3 toolkit for the X
window system.  Trestle is a collection of interfaces structured
around a central abstract type: a "virtual bitmap terminal" or VBT,
which represents a share of the workstation's screen, keyboard, and
mouse---a thing comparable to the viewers, windows, or widgets of
other systems.
<P>
Trestle is included in SRC Modula-3 version 2.0, which is available
via public ftp.

Trestle includes a fairly standard set of interactors, including
menus, buttons, "container" classes that provide overlapping or tiled
subwindows, and "leaf" windows that display text or other data. This
reference manual also specifies the interfaces that allow you to
create your own window classes. Knowledge of X is not required.
<P>
A Trestle window is an object whose behavior is determined by its
methods. For example, a window's response to a mouse click is
determined by calling its mouse method. This is fast becoming the
standard architecture for toolkits, but Trestle carries it further
than most. For example, you can change the way a Trestle window paints
by overriding its paint method; this is useful for sophisticated
effects like groupware.
<P>
Trestle provides a novel strategy for writing applications that are
independent of the type of display screen they are running on. For
example, it is easy to write a Trestle application that can be moved
back and forth between a color display and a monochrome display where
the application will look good on both.
