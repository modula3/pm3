"There are lots of interesting
problems in window systems", said Butler Lampson to Greg Nelson in
April, 1984; and he was right. Nelson was enticed into the design
meetings for the new window system for the Firefly multiprocessor at
SRC. In 1984 most of the discussions were about what came to be called
the event-time protocol, and besides Lampson and Nelson the main
participants were Mark R. Brown, Jim Horning, and Lyle Ramshaw. Mark
Brown and Greg Nelson wrote the first version of the VBT interface.

Mark Manasse joined SRC in 1985, and he and Nelson finished the design
and implementation of the first version of Trestle (then called
Trellis), which they shipped for use at SRC on December 31st, 1985.

Trestle evolved for five years, improving under feedback from the
projects that built upon it, notably Luca Cardelli's Dialog Editor,
Mark R. Brown's Ivy text editor, Marc H. Brown's FormsVBT system,
Patrick Chan's session manager Rooms, and a number of applications
built by Andrew Birrell. Bob Ayers's Facade system spurred the Trestle
team into performance work that otherwise might never have been
undertaken.

In 1990 and 1991, Steve Glassman, Mark Manasse, and Greg
Nelson overhauled Trestle to make it into the portable Modula-3 X
toolkit described in this reference manual. We are grateful to the
Modula-3 export sites that used the alpha-test version of the system
released in January 1991; special thanks for the helpful feedback from
Dave Goldberg, Norman Ramsey, Jim Meehan, and Marc H. Brown. Finally,
we thank Patrick Chan, James Mason, and Jim Horning, who carefully
read the entire reference manual and made many helpful suggestions.
