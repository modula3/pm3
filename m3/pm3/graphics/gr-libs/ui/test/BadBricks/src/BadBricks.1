NAME
    BadBricks - silly game

SYNTAX
    BadBricks

DESCRIPTION
    This game only makes sense if you were at SRC during the summer
    of '91, or if you just happen to love buildings with false brick
    facades.  Click the mouse buttons on bricks; curse at Luca.

    Future developments may include:  Olympic Drug Testing, Bumper
    Cars (aim for yellow poles), and Escape from the Grisly Garage.
