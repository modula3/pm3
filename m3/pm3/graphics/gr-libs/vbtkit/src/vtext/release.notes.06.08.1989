I've just released a new version of the vtext package, used in Ivy and
elsewhere.

Among the changes:

 * VText can now display visible tabs in a style other than \011.  When
   creating a VFont, if NOT ('\t' IN visibles), then tabs display as
   '\011'.  Otherwise, if whiteTabs is TRUE, they display as a variable
   amount of white space.  Otherwise, they display as a special symbol of
   the same varying width.

 * VText can now display a visible end-of-buffer indicator.  The "eob"
   parameter in a VOptions is a BOOLEAN that controls this.

 * VText tries to display variable-width fonts in a more flash-free
   fashion.

Cheers,
John
