This directory contains log files written by an instrumented version
of Juno to be read by the UnionFind Zeus animation. The logs written
by the instrumented Juno are not in exactly the correct format
accepted by the animation; they must be run through the "reorder"
shell script in this directory first. The files in this directory are:

  reorder    program to transform ".log" files into ".sx" files

  *.log      the log file written by the instrumented version of Juno
  *.sx       the files produced from the ".log" files by "reorder"
  *.juno     the Juno command that was run to produce the ".log" file
  *.solve    a dump produced by the Juno compiler of the ".juno" command

See the "reorder" script itself for directions of its use.
