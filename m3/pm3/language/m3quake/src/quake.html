<H1>=Quake</H1>

<P>
<B>Quake</B> is a simple, specialized
language drawing on elements of the C language, the
Bourne shell, and the C pre-processor.
<P>

<B>Quake</B> was designed to be a component of
<A HREF="../../modula3/m3compiler/m3build/src">m3build</A>.
Building a complete, general-purpose language was not
one of the goals. M3build
reads a set of <B>quake</B> language templates that define some
operators, then executes an m3makefile in this context.  The templates
define procedures to build lists of modules, libraries, and so on.

<H2>Values</H2>
<P>

<B>Quake</B> is designed to make it easy to assemble arrays and tables of
strings.  The value space is strings, arrays of strings, and tables of
strings.  An array is a list of elements, and a table is a set of
key/value pairs where the keys in a table are all distinct.
<P>

<H3>Strings</H3>
<P>

A string is a sequence (delimited by `"') of characters excluding
newline and double quote.  Several special characters may be quoted
(with `\') as follows:
<PRE>
    new-line    ignored
    \\          \
    \n          new-line
    \r          return
    \t          tab
    \b          backspace
    \f          formfeed
    \"          double quote
</PRE>
<P>

<H3>Arrays</H3>
<P>

An array is constructed using `[' and `]'.  `[]' is the empty array,
`["a"]' is an array of the single string "a".  Elements are separated by
`,'.  Thus `["a", "b"]' is an array of two elements---the strings "a"
and "b".
<P>

Arrays are flattened whenever they are referenced.  This means that
`["a", ["b", "c"]]' is converted the the array `["a", "b", "c"]'.  This
means that an array can never be the element of another array.
<P>

Arrays are accessed by an integer index.  `a[2]' is the third element of
the array a.  The index expression may also be a string which will be
converted to an integer.  The range of the index is checked at run-time.
<P>

<H3>Tables</H3>
<P>

A table is constructed using `{' and `}'.  `{}' is the empty table.
Elements of a table are given as key/value pairs.  An empty value may be
omitted.  `{"a", "b"}' is a table containing two keys---the strings "a"
and "b". `{"p" : "q"}' is the constructor for a table with the single
key "p" whose value is the string "q". Missing values are returned as
"".
<P>

Tables are accessed using expressions of the form `s{"a"}'.  This
evaluates to the value of the key "a" in the table s.
<P>

<H2>Names</H2>
<P>

Names in <B>quake</B> start with an letter (`a'..`z', `A'..`Z') or an
underscore (`_'), followed by those characters, digits (`0'..`9'),
hyphens (`-'), or periods (`.').
<P>

If the lookup for a name fails (it is undefined in any of the enclosing
scopes) it is installed in the current scope with an initial string
value of the text of the name.
<P>

<H2>Comments</H2>
<P>

C-style comments are supported (delimited by `/*' and `*/') and do not
nest.
<P>

Single-line comments are introduced with `%' and terminated with a new-line.
<P>

<H2>Conditionals</H2>
<P>

A Boolean value is represented as a string.  The empty string is false,
and any other string is true.
<P>

<H2>Expressions</H2>
<P>

An expression is:
<PRE>
    string:                  "baz"
    name:                    foo
    environment variable:    $CPU_TYPE
    array selector:          array[5]
    array constructor:       ["a", "b"]
    table selector:          t{"a"}
    table constructor:       {"a" : "p", b}
    function call:           f(a, "b")
    parentheses:             a and (b or f(c))
</PRE>
<P>

Operators are all left-associative, precedence is decreases from top to
bottom in the following list.
<PRE>
    &amp;           string catenation (`"Hello, " &amp; foo')
    contains    table inclusion (`s contains "a"')
    not         logical negation (`not a')
    and         logical conjunction (`c and not d')
    or          logical disjunction (`a or b')
</PRE>
<P>

A note on string catenation.  Operands of `&amp;' are converted to strings
whenever required and possible. Arrays and tables are converted to
strings by catenating their elements (for tables, their keys) separated
by a single spaces. For example, the expression
<PRE>
    "a" &amp; " " &amp; ["b", "c"]
</PRE>
<P>evaluates to the string "a b c".

<H2>Statements</H2>
<P>

A statement is either an assignment, a procedure definition, a procedure
invocation, a conditional statement, or a loop.

<H3>Assignment</H3>
<P>
Assign an expression (the string "bar") to the variable `foo' with
<PRE>
    foo = "bar"
</PRE>
<P>

If `foo' already exists, and is an array, then
<PRE>
    foo += "baz"
</PRE>
<P>extends the array to include a new final element; the string "baz".


<H3>Scope</H3>
<P>

<B>Quake</B> has a global name space, but local scopes are always introduced
when a procedure is called, and a `foreach' loop is executed.
<P>

Scopes are searched from innermost to outermost each time a name is
looked up.  The outermost scope is always the global scope.
<P>

Assignments can be made local to the innermost scope by prefixing the
assignment statement with the keyword `local'. For example,
<PRE>
    local foo = "bog"
</PRE>
<P>In which case the values of any other instances of `foo' in other scopes
are hidden. The previous value of `foo' is restored once the local scope
is released by exiting the procedure or `foreach' loop.
<P>

To protect a name in the current scope, use
<PRE>
    readonly dec = "digital"
</PRE>

<H3>Procedures</H3>
<P>

Procedures may be defined in the global scope only.  Here is the
definition of a procedure `simple', taking two arguments bound to the
local names `prefix' and `suffix' in the procedure's local scope.
<PRE>
    proc simple(prefix, suffix) is
      q = prefix &amp; "." &amp; suffix
    end
</PRE>
<P>
The string `prefix &amp; "." &amp; suffix' is assigned to the global variable
`q'.
<P>

This procedure can then be invoked with
<PRE>
    simple("Hello", "m3")
</PRE>
<P>

Procedures can return values, in which case they become functions.  For
example,
<PRE>
    proc combine(prefix, suffix) is
      return prefix &amp; "." &amp; suffix
    end
</PRE>
<P>defines a function `combine' which catenates and returns the three
strings `prefix', ".", and `suffix'.  Now the function `combine' can be
used in an expression, for example
<PRE>
    q = combine("Hello", "m3")
</PRE>
<P>assigns the string "Hello.m3" to `q'.

<H3>Conditional Statements</H3>
<P>

Values may be tested using the `if' statement. For example,
<PRE>
    if compiling
      message = "compiling"
    end
</PRE>
<P>

If statements may have an else part, for example
<PRE>
    if not (ready or interested)
      return
    else
      message = "congratulations"
    end
</PRE>
<P>returns from the current procedure if the test succeeds, otherwise
executes the assignment statement.

<H3>Loops</H3>
<P>

`Foreach' statements iterate over the string values in an array or in a
table. For example,
<PRE>
    foreach file in [".login", ".profile", ".Xdefaults"]
      write("Copying " &amp; file &amp; " to " &amp; backup_dir &amp; "0)
      copy_file(file, backup_dir)
    end
</PRE>
<P>binds the name `file' to each of ".login", ".profile", and ".Xdefaults"
in turn in a local scope. This example assumes that the procedures
`copy_file', and the variable `backup_dir' have already been defined.
<P>

Here is a function `squeeze' to remove duplicates from an array
<PRE>
    proc squeeze(array) is
      local t = {}

      foreach i in array
        t{i} = ""
      end

      return [t]
    end
</PRE>
<P>

<H2>Keywords</H2>
<P>

Here is a list of reserved words in <B>quake</B>:
<PRE>
    and  contains  else  end  foreach  if  in
    is  local  not  or  proc  readonly  return
</PRE>

<H2>Built-in Procedures</H2>
<P>

<B>Quake</B> has a small collection of built-in procedures.  Built-ins cannot
be redefined.  The built-ins `write' and `exec' are variadic.

<UL>

<LI><B>write(...)</B>
Writes its arguments to the current output stream. Unlike the
conversion of arrays to strings, there are no extra spaces inserted
between arguments.

<LI><B>error(...)</B>
Writes its argument to the standard error stream and stops running
<B>quake</B> with an error return value.

<LI><B>include(file)</B>
The contents of `file' is interpreted by <B>quake</B> in place of the call
to `include'.  This is analogous the `#include' directive in the C
preprocessor.  Calls to `include' nest until you run out of file
descriptors or something equally bad.

<LI><B>cp_if(src, dest)</B>
If the file `src' differs from the file `dest', or `dest' is missing,
copy `src' to `dest'.
</UL>

<H2>Built-in Functions</H2>

<UL>
<LI><B>arglist(pfx, array)</B>
This function may be used to avoid the problems of limited space
for argument lists in some command interpreters.  Some commands
(notably `m3', the Modula-3 driver program) are prepared to accept
arguments from a file.  The syntax for this is `-Ffile'.
<P>

Thus, `arglist("-F", really_huge_array)'
returns either the original array if it's not really all that huge,
or it creates a temporary file containing a list of the strings in
the array (one to a line) and returns the string "-Ftemp" where
`temp' is the name of the temporary file.

<LI><B>defined(foo)</B>
Returns true if `foo' is defined, otherwise returns false. Remember
that the Boolean values false and true are represented as empty and
non-empty strings respectively.  In this example, `foo' looks like
a name, and is evaluated before begin passed to `defined'.  So if
you really want to find out whether `foo' is defined, use
`defined("foo")'.

<LI><B>empty(foo)</B>
Returns true if the string, array, or table is empty, false
otherwise.

<LI><B>equal(foo, bar)</B>
Returns true if the strings `foo' and `bar' are equivalent.

<LI><B>exec(cmd,io,wd,env)</B>
executes the child process specified in cmd and returns the child
return code. Cmd is an array containing the executable command followed
by the individual command line arguments. The following arguments
are optional. An array of file names is used for io to specify
the standard input, output and error. Empty names refer to the
existing standard files. When wd is present, it specifies the
working directory. Finally, env is a vector of text which must have
the form "NAME=VALUE".

<LI><B>escape(s)</B>
Returns the string `s' with backslash characters doubled.

<LI><B>format(s, a...)</B>
Returns the string `s' with each instance of `%s' replaced by
successive `a' arguments.  The number of `a' arguments
must match the number of `%s's.

<LI><B>normalize(p, q)</B>
If the path `p' is a prefix of the path `q', returns the path
from directory `p' to file `q'.  Otherwise, returns `q'.

<LI><B>path()</B>
Returns the directory of the currently executing file as a string.

<LI><B>stale(target, deps)</B>
`target' is interpreted as a file name, as is `deps' (or the
elements of `deps' if it's an array).  If the files `target' or
`deps' cannot be found, or if (one of) `deps' is more recent than
`target', `stale' returns true, otherwise false.

<LI><B>unlink_file(f)</B>
Deletes the file `f'.
</UL>

<H2>Output Redirection</H2>

<P>
Output (from the `write' built-in procedure) may be temporarily
redirected as follows:
<PRE>
    &gt; "foo.txt" in
      write("Hello, world0)
    end
</PRE>
<P>The output of the calls to `write' is written to the file `foo.txt'.

<P>
Output may be appended to a file by using `>>' in place of `>'.

<P>
The special file names `_stdout' and `_stderr' are special and are bound
to the file descriptors corresponding to normal and error terminal
output respectively.

<P>
The default for output is the normal terminal stream.

<H2>Notes</H2>
<P>

<B>Quake</B> does not garbage collect.  Reckless copying of large arrays can
bloat the heap.
