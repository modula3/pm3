	 A TRUE temp parameter means that the value returned by this
	 operation is "temporary", that is, it will immediately be passed
	 as a parameter to another operation. A temp optimization
	 is implemented for integers and reals, to recycle their allocated
	 value cells, within the built-in "int", "real", and "math" libraries.
	 IMPORTANT: Any library operations that returns an integer or a
	 real cells must obey these invariants: (A) It is sufficient to 
	 actively ensure cell.temp=FALSE for any int or real result cell. 
         (B) However, it is preferable to satisfy the following: (1) The temp
	 field of an int or real cell that is returned more than once must be 
	 set to FALSE. (2) The temp field of a newly allocated int or real
	 cell that is returned must be set to the temp parameter of Eval. 
	 (3) An int or real cell that is received as an argument has cell.temp
	 already set to FALSE (except for "int", "real", and "math" operations)..
	 (C) In any other situation, the temp parameter may be ignored.

NOTES:
  How to structure the body of EvalFoo is up to you; this is just an
    example with efficient opcode dispatching. The body could also be a big 
    if-then-else testing the text names of the opcodes.

  In ObValue.BadArgType, "1" is the argument number, and "int" is
    the expected argument type.

  In ObValue.BadArgVal, "1" is the argument number, and "non-negative"
    completes the error message "argument 1 must be ...".

  Results must be legal ObValue.Val (not NIL!). See Obliq.i3
    for convenient value constructors and constants.
