This package contains miscellaneous modules that support the Modula-3
toolkit.

M3Args          Keyword/value (command-line) argument package
M3Assert        Toolkit specific assertions
M3Time          (Clean) Elapsed CPU time interface

This package has been extracted from m3tk as several of its modules
are used in different other packages, which do not need to depend on
the whole huge m3tk package. (ow 2001-12-06)
