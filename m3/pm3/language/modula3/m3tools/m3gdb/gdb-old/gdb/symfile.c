LOCAL FUNCTION

	compare_psymbols -- compare two partial symbols by name

DESCRIPTION

	Given pointers to pointers to two partial symbol table entries,
	compare them by name and return -N, 0, or +N (ala strcmp).
	Typically used by sorting routines like qsort().

NOTES

	Does direct compare of first two characters before punting
	and passing to strcmp for longer compares.  Note that the
	original version had a bug whereby two null strings or two
	identically named one character strings would return the
	comparison of memory following the null byte.

/* clear_symtab_users_once:

   This function is run after symbol reading, or from a cleanup.
   If an old symbol table was obsoleted, the old symbol table
   has been blown away, but the other GDB data structures that may 
   reference it have not yet been cleared or re-directed.  (The old
   symtab was zapped, and the cleanup queued, in free_named_symtab()
   below.)

   This function can be queued N times as a cleanup, or called
   directly; it will do all the work the first time, and then will be a
   no-op until the next time it is queued.  This works by bumping a
   counter at queueing time.  Much later when the cleanup is run, or at
   the end of symbol processing (in case the cleanup is discarded), if
   the queued count is greater than the "done-count", we do the work
   and set the done-count to the queued count.  If the queued count is
   less than or equal to the done-count, we just ignore the call.  This
   is needed because reading a single .o file will often replace many
   symtabs (one per .h file, for example), and we don't want to reset
   the breakpoints N times in the user's face.

   The reason we both queue a cleanup, and call it directly after symbol
   reading, is because the cleanup protects us in case of errors, but is
   discarded if symbol reading is successful.  */
