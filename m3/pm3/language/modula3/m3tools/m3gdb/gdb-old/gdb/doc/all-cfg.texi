@c GDB MANUAL configuration file.  
@c Copyright (c) 1993 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
@c
@c NOTE: While the GDB manual is configurable (by changing these
@c switches), its configuration is ***NOT*** automatically tied in to
@c source configuration---because the authors expect that, save in
@c unusual cases, the most inclusive form of the manual is appropriate
@c no matter how the program itself is configured.
@c
@c The only automatically-varying variable is the GDB version number,
@c which the Makefile rewrites based on the VERSION variable from
@c `../Makefile.in'.  
@c 
@c GDB version number is recorded in the variable GDBVN
@include GDBvn.texi
