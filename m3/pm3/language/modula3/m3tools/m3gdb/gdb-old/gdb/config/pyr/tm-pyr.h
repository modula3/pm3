/* Traditional Unix virtual address spaces have thre regions: text,
   data and stack.  The text, initialised data, and uninitialised data
   are represented in separate segments of the a.out file.
   When a process dumps core, the data and stack regions are written
   to a core file.  This gives a debugger enough information to
   reconstruct (and debug) the virtual address space at the time of
   the coredump.
   Pyramids have an distinct fourth region of the virtual address
   space, in which the contents of the windowed registers are stacked
   in fixed-size frames.  Pyramid refer to this region as the control
   stack.  Each call (or trap) automatically allocates a new register
   frame; each return deallocates the current frame and restores the
   windowed registers to their values before the call.

   When dumping core, the control stack is written to a core files as
   a third segment. The core-handling functions need to know to deal

   the address we return for it IS the sp for the next frame.

   Note that on register window machines, we are currently making the
   assumption that window registers are being saved somewhere in the
   frame in which they are being used.  If they are stored in an
   inferior frame, find_saved_register will break.

   On pyrs, frames of window registers are stored contiguously on a
   separate stack.  All window registers are always stored.
   The pc and psw (gr15 and gr14)  are also always saved: the call
   insn saves them in pr15 and pr14 of the new frame (tr15,tr14 of the
   old frame).  
   The data-stack frame pointer (CFP) is only saved in functions which
   allocate a (data)stack frame (with "adsf").  We detect them by
   looking at the first insn of the procedure. 

   Other non-window registers (gr0-gr11) are never saved.  Pyramid's C
   compiler and gcc currently ignore them, so it's not an issue.   */
