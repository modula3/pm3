/* This change should not be needed, FIXME!  We should

   express what goes on here.

      INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO is called from two places: create_new_frame
      		(where the PC is already set up) and here (where it isn't).
      INIT_FRAME_PC is only called from here, always after
      		INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO.
   
   The catch is the MIPS, where INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO requires the PC
   value (which hasn't been set yet).  Some other machines appear to
   require INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO before they can do INIT_FRAME_PC.  Phoo.

   We shouldn't need INIT_FRAME_PC_FIRST to add more complication to
   an already overcomplicated part of GDB.   gnu@cygnus.com, 15Sep92.

   Assuming that some machines need INIT_FRAME_PC after
   INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO, one possible scheme:

   SETUP_INNERMOST_FRAME()
     Default version is just create_new_frame (read_fp ()),
     read_pc ()).  Machines with extra frame info would do that (or the
     local equivalent) and then set the extra fields.
   SETUP_ARBITRARY_FRAME(argc, argv)
     Only change here is that create_new_frame would no longer init extra
     frame info; SETUP_ARBITRARY_FRAME would have to do that.
   INIT_PREV_FRAME(fromleaf, prev)
     Replace INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO and INIT_FRAME_PC.  This should
     also return a flag saying whether to keep the new frame, or
     whether to discard it, because on some machines (e.g.  mips) it
     is really awkward to have FRAME_CHAIN_VALID called *before*
     INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO (there is no good way to get information
     deduced in FRAME_CHAIN_VALID into the extra fields of the new frame).
   std_frame_pc(fromleaf, prev)
     This is the default setting for INIT_PREV_FRAME.  It just does what
     the default INIT_FRAME_PC does.  Some machines will call it from
     INIT_PREV_FRAME (either at the beginning, the end, or in the middle).
     Some machines won't use it.
