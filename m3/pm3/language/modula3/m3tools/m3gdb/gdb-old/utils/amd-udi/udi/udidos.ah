; The following structure is filled in by a small assembly
; language piece of code that runs when UDIDisconnect is
; called by the DFE. It is used by a small piece of assembly
; code on the DFE side IF the TIP used DOS Exit to clean it-
; self up. The DFE side code then "returns" on behalf of the
; TIP.
; This structure should track with a C language version of
; the same structure in udidos.h.
