Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
produce both on-line information and printed output.  This means that
instead of writing two different documents, one for the on-line help
or other on-line information and the other for a typeset manual or
other printed work, you need write only one document.  When the work
is revised, you need revise only one document.  You can read the
on-line information, known as an "Info file", with an Info
documentation-reading program.  By convention, Texinfo source file
names end with a `.texi' or `.texinfo' extension.  Texinfo is
described in the Texinfo Manual.

You can write and format Texinfo files into Info files within GNU
Emacs, and read them using the Emacs Info reader.  If you do not have
Emacs, you can format Texinfo files into Info files using `makeinfo'
and read them using `info'.  Use TeX, which is not included in this
package, to typeset Texinfo files for printing.

For instructions on installing info, makeinfo, texi2dvi, and texindex,
please read the file `INSTALL'.  The Emacs Lisp files are not
installed by default; to install them, use `make install' in the
`emacs' subdirectory.

This distribution includes (but is not limited to) the following files:

    INTRODUCTION                This file tells you how to create
                                readable files from the Texinfo source
                                files in this distribution.

Texinfo source files:

    texinfo.texi                This manual describes Texinfo.  It
                                tells how to use Texinfo to write
                                documentation, how to use Texinfo mode
                                in GNU Emacs, how to use TeX,
                                makeinfo, and the Emacs Lisp Texinfo
                                formatting commands.

    info.texi                   This manual tells you how to use 
                                Info.  This document comes as part of
                                GNU Emacs.  If you do not have Emacs,
                                you can format this Texinfo source
                                file with makeinfo or TeX and then
                                read the resulting Info file with the
                                standalone Info reader that is part of
                                this distribution.

    info-stnd.texi              This manual tells you how to use
                                the standalone GNU Info reader that is
                                included in this distribution as a C
                                source file, `info.c'.

    makeinfo.texi               This manual tells you how to use
                                makeinfo.  The same information is
                                contained in a chapter of the Texinfo
                                manual; it has been extracted here for
                                your convenience.

    texinfo.tex                 This TeX definitions file tells
                                the TeX program how to typeset a
                                Texinfo file into a DVI file ready for
                                printing.

    texindex.c                  This file contains the source for

    configure                   This file creates creates a Makefile 
                                which in turn creates an `info' or

                                features since the first edition 
                                of Texinfo.

    info.1                      This is a `man' page that briefly 
                                describes the standalone `info'
