.SH DESCRIPTION

Use `\|\c
.BI run " program"\c
\&\|' to execute a binary by interpreting machine instructions on your
host computer.

.B run
is the same emulator used by GDB's `\|\c
.B target sim\c
\&\|' command.  You can run it directly by executing
.B run
if you just want to see your program execute, and do not need any
debugger functionality.  You can also use
.B run
to generate profiling information for analysis with
.BR gprof .

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-v
Verbose output.  Display the name of the program to run before
execution; after execution, display the number of instructions
executed, the number of machine cycles emulated, the number of
pipeline stalls, the real time taken, the emulated execution time
taken, and a summary of how much profiling information was generated.
."
." .TP
." .B \-t
." `trace', calls a sim_trace routine that does nothing.

.TP
.BI \-p " freq"
Generate profile information (for use with
.B gprof\c
\&).
.I freq
is the profiling frequency.  Write the profiling information to a file called
.BR gmon.out .

.TP
.BI \-m " memory"
Set the memory size for the emulated machine to two to the power
.IR memory .
The default value is 19, emulating a board with 524288 bytes of memory.
