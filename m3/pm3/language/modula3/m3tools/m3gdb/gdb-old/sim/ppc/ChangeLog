	* std-config.h (SEMANTICS_INLINE): By default, mask out the
        inlining of semantic functions from DEFAULT_INLINE.  Almost all
        configurations call the semantic code via a pointer so there is

 	always update the cache_entries semantic and address fields.

	* gen-idecode.c (print_idecode_switch_illegal): Include a break
 	when generating illegal instructions.  This was commented out
 	which is a hangover from looking a at switch statements generated

	* configure.in (icache): Extend icache flag to include an insn

        the instruction cache.  Make this the default.
	* configure: re-generate.

	* igen.c (main), igen.h: Add option -S - inSn - for specifying
        that the instruction should be included in the icache.

	* gen-idecode.c: Output the complete run_until_stop function

	* : Have the generated idecode.c include inline.c (instead of psim.c).

	* std-config.h: Change psim.c so that it isn't inlined (as this is
        no longer needed).

	* psim.c (run_until_stop): Delete the old run_until_stop function
        instead calling the idecode_run and idecode_run_until_stop
        functions that gen-idecode.c is now creating.

        corresponding call to ITRACE so that it still matches.

	* idecode_expression.h (ALU_END, CR0_COMPARE): Use TRACE instead
        of ITRACE.  The CPP line directives would have previously set the
        line-nr and file name so ITRACE isn't needed.

        decode functions.

	* configure.in (--enable-sim-icache): Accept an option list such
        as 1024,define.  Add a new choice to the list - semantic - which
        will cause igen to generate instruction decode functions that
        include the corresponding semantic code.

Sun Jul 21 21:18:05 1996  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@kremvax.highland.com.au>

	* configure.in: New option --enable-sim-line-nr (default enabled).

	* Makefile.in (filter.o): Adjust
	* configure.in: Adjust filter flag so that default includes 32bit
