.SH NAME
\fBudi\fP \- UDI Configuration Files for DOS hosts.
.sp
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
A UDI conformant Debugger Front End (DFE) specifies the Target
Interface Process (TIP) that it wishes to connect to and
the options that it wishes to pass to that TIP by referencing
a configuration in the "UDI configuration file".
This man page explains the format of the UDI Configuration file
for DOS hosts.
.sp
The search rules that the DFE uses to locate the UDI Configuration
file are:
.IP
the complete filename specified by the environment variable, UDICONF.
.IP
the file udiconfs.txt in the current directory.
.IP
the file udiconfs.txt in each of the directories specified by the PATH environment
variable.
.sp
.LP
Each line of the udiconfs.txt file consists of the following fields:
.IP
tip_config_name  tip_executable  [tip_options]
.TP 10
.I tip_config_name
An arbitrary name which the DFE will use to refer to this configuration.
Each line in the udiconfs.txt file must have a different tip_config_name field.	
.TP
.I tip_executable
The name of the TIP executable file.  The DFE will
use the tip_executable filename to spawn
the TIP if the TIP is not already running. If a full pathname is
not specified, the PATH environment variable
is used to locate the executable file.
.sp
.TP
.I tip_options
The rest of the line after the tip_executable name is passed
to the TIP at connect time.
.sp
.SH EXAMPLES OF UDI CONFIGURATION FILE ENTRIES
.sp
The following is an exampleare examples of entries in the UDI configuration 
file for DOS hosts. 
.sp
\fB iss050  isstip.exe -29050 -r osboot \fR
.sp
The above entry associates the TIP configuration name "iss050" with the
\fBisstip.exe\fR executable with the parameters
"-29050 -r osboot" being passed to isstip.exe
when it is invoked.  If isstip.exe is not already running and
needs to be spawned, the PATH environment variable will be used to
locate the file isstip.exe.
