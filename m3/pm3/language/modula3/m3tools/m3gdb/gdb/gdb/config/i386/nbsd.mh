# NATDEPFILES must remain entirely on one line for *BSD.  When
# building a cross debugger, configure will cause this line to be
# commented out in the Makefile.  BSD make doesn't permit the use of a
# continuation character (backslash) to extend a commented line.  As a
# consequence, BSD make considers subsequent tab-indented lines to be
# "unassociated shell commands".
