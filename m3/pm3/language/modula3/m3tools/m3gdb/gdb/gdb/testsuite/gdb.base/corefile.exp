# Test that we can simply startup with a "-core=corefile" command line arg
# and recognize that the core file is a valid, usable core file.
# To do this, we must shutdown the currently running gdb and restart
# with the -core args.  We can't use gdb_start because it looks for
# the first gdb prompt, and the message we are looking for occurs
# before the first prompt.  Also, we can't include GDBFLAGS because
# if it is empty, this confuses gdb with an empty argument that it
# grumbles about (said grumbling currently being ignored in gdb_start).
# **FIXME**
#
# Another problem is that on some systems (solaris for example), there
# is apparently a limit on the length of a fully specified path to 
# the coremaker executable, at about 80 chars.  For this case, consider
# it a pass, but note that the program name is bad.
