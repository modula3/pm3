/* For SVR4 shared libraries, each call to a library routine goes through
   a small piece of trampoline code in the ".plt" section.
   The horribly ugly wait_for_inferior() routine uses this macro to detect
   when we have stepped into one of these fragments.
   We do not use lookup_solib_trampoline_symbol_by_pc, because
   we cannot always find the shared library trampoline symbols
   (e.g. on Irix5).  */

/* It is unknown which, if any, SVR4 assemblers do not accept dollar signs
   in identifiers.  The default in G++ is to use dots instead, for all SVR4
   systems, so we make that our default also.  FIXME: There should be some
   way to get G++ to tell us what CPLUS_MARKER it is using, perhaps by
   stashing it in the debugging information as part of the name of an
   invented symbol ("gcc_cplus_marker$" for example). */
