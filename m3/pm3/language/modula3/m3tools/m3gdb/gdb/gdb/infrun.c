/* If the program uses ELF-style shared libraries, then calls to
   functions in shared libraries go through stubs, which live in a
   table called the PLT (Procedure Linkage Table).  The first time the
   function is called, the stub sends control to the dynamic linker,
   which looks up the function's real address, patches the stub so
   that future calls will go directly to the function, and then passes
   control to the function.

   If we are stepping at the source level, we don't want to see any of
   this --- we just want to skip over the stub and the dynamic linker.
   The simple approach is to single-step until control leaves the
   dynamic linker.

   However, on some systems (e.g., Red Hat Linux 5.2) the dynamic
   linker calls functions in the shared C library, so you can't tell
   from the PC alone whether the dynamic linker is still running.  In
   this case, we use a step-resume breakpoint to get us past the
   dynamic linker, as if we were using "next" to step over a function
   call.

   IN_SOLIB_DYNSYM_RESOLVE_CODE says whether we're in the dynamic
   linker code or not.  Normally, this means we single-step.  However,
   if SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER then returns non-zero, then its value is an
   address where we can place a step-resume breakpoint to get past the
   linker's symbol resolution function.

   IN_SOLIB_DYNSYM_RESOLVE_CODE can generally be implemented in a
   pretty portable way, by comparing the PC against the address ranges
   of the dynamic linker's sections.

   SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER is generally going to be system-specific, since
   it depends on internal details of the dynamic linker.  It's usually
   not too hard to figure out where to put a breakpoint, but it
   certainly isn't portable.  SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER should do plenty of
   sanity checking.  If it can't figure things out, returning zero and
   getting the (possibly confusing) stepping behavior is better than
   signalling an error, which will obscure the change in the
   inferior's state.  */

     For instance, on ptrace-based HPUX we receive the child's vfork
     event first, at which time the parent has been suspended by the
     OS and is essentially untouchable until the child's exit or second
     exec event arrives.  At that time, the parent's vfork event is
     delivered to us, and that's when we see and decide how to follow
     the vfork.  But to get to that point, we must continue the child
     until it execs or exits.  To do that smoothly, all breakpoints
     must be removed from the child, in case there are any set between
     the vfork() and exec() calls.  But removing them from the child
     also removes them from the parent, due to the shared-address-space
     nature of a vfork'd parent and child.  On HPUX, therefore, we must
     take care to restore the bp's to the parent before we continue it.
     Else, it's likely that we may not stop in the expected place.  (The
     worst scenario is when the user tries to step over a vfork() call;
     the step-resume bp must be restored for the step to properly stop
     in the parent after the call completes!)

	   This used to jump to step_over_function if we are stepping,

	   Suppose the user does a `next' over a function call, and while
	   that call is in progress, the inferior receives a signal for
	   which GDB does not stop (i.e., signal_stop[SIG] is false).  In
	   that case, when we reach this point, there is already a

	   immediately after the function call the user is "next"-ing
	   over.  If we call step_over_function now, two bad things
	   happen:

	   - we'll create a new breakpoint, at wherever the current
	     frame's return address happens to be.  That could be
	     anywhere, depending on what function call happens to be on
	     the top of the stack at that point.  Point is, it's probably
	     not where we need it.

           - the existing step-resume breakpoint (which is at the correct
	     address) will get orphaned: step_resume_breakpoint will point
	     to the new breakpoint, and the old step-resume breakpoint
	     will never be cleaned up.

           The old behavior was meant to help HP-UX single-step out of
           sigtramps.  It would place the new breakpoint at prev_pc, which
           was certainly wrong.  I don't know the details there, so fixing
           this probably breaks that.  As with anything else, it's up to
           the HP-UX maintainer to furnish a fix that doesn't break other
           platforms.  --JimB, 20 May 1999 */
