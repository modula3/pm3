   This routine is also responsible for implementing the policy that

   This policy is that when reading an existing mapped file, a file of
   the correct name in the current directory takes precedence over a
   file of the correct name in the same directory as the symbol file.
   When creating a new mapped file, it is always created in the current
   directory.  This helps to minimize the chances of a user unknowingly
   creating big mapped files in places like /bin and /usr/local/bin, and
