[Readline-specific changelog.  Descriptions of changes to the source are
 found in the bash changelog.]

				    6/9
				    ---
Makefile.in
	- quote value of ${INSTALL_DATA} when passing it to makes in
	  subdirectories

				    7/1
				    ---
Makefile.in
	- don't pass INSTALL_DATA to a make in the `doc' subdirectory; let
	  autoconf set the value itself in the Makefile
	- removed a stray `-' before $(RANLIB) in the `install' recipe

doc/Makefile.in
	- add a VPATH assignment so the documentation is not remade if it's
	  already up-to-date in the distribution

configure.in
	- call AC_SUBST(LOCAL_LDFLAGS), since Makefile.in contains
	  @LOCAL_LDFLAGS@

				    7/9
				    ---

config.h.in
	- add define lines for STRUCT_WINSIZE_IN_SYS_IOCTL and
	  STRUCT_WINSIZE_IN_TERMIOS

configure.in
	- call BASH_STRUCT_WINSIZE to look for the definition of
	  `struct winsize'

configure.in
	- call AC_MINIX

config.h.in
	- add define line for AC_MINIX

	- bumped LIBVERSION up to 2.1.1, indicating that this is patch
	  level 1 to release 2.1


				   9/16
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- `make distclean' now descends into the `examples' subdir

doc/Makefile.in

				   4/18
				   ----
[readline-2.2 released]

				   4/20
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- make `libhistory.a' a dependency of `install'
	- fixed a typo in the recipe for `install' that copied libreadline.a
	  to libhistory.old right after installing it

				   4/27
				   ----
doc/Makefile.in
	- install {readline,history}.info out of the source directory if
	  they are not found in the current (build) directory -- only an
	  issue if the libraries are built in a different directory than
	  the source directory

				    5/1
				    ---
support/shobj-conf
	- script from the bash distribution to do shared object and library
	  configuration

shlib/Makefile.in
	- new directory and makefile to handle building shared versions of
	  libreadline and libhistory, controlled by support/shobj-conf

				   5/14
				   ----
savestring.c
	- new file, moved from shell.c, for backwards compatibility

Makefile.in, shlib/Makefile.in
	- make sure savestring.c is compiled and added to libreadline and
	  libhistory

[THERE ARE NO MORE #ifdef SHELL LINES IN THE C SOURCE FILES.]

				   5/15
				   ----
README
	- updated description of shared library creation for the new scheme

[THERE ARE NO MORE #ifdef SHELL LINES IN ANY OF THE SOURCE FILES.]

Makefile.in
	- bumped SHLIB_MAJOR up to 4 since we've augmented the library
	  API
	- rlconf.h is now one of the installed headers, so applications can
	  find out whether things like vi-mode are available in the installed
	  libreadline

				   5/20
				   ----
configure.in
	- changed RL_LIBRARY_VERSION to 4.0 to match the version of the
	  installed shared libraries

				    6/5
				    ---
rlstdc.h
	- new file

Makefile.in
	- rlstdc.h is now one of the installed headers

				    8/3
				    ---
shlib/Makefile.in
	- made the suffix rule that creates xx.so from xx.c write the
	  compiler output to `a.o', which is then mv'd to xx.so, because
	  some compilers (Sun WSpro 4.2, for example) don't allow any
	  suffixes other than `.o' for `cc -c' (not even `a.out')

				   9/15
				   ----

Makefile.in
	- AR and ARFLAGS are now substituted by configure, used in recipes
	  that build the libraries

configure.in
	- use AC_CHECK_PROG to check for ar
	- set ARFLAGS if it has not already been set in the environment

				   10/5
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- removed savestring.o from object file list

				   10/28
				   -----
shlib/Makefile.in
	- don't use a fixed filename in the .c.so suffix rule to avoid
	  problems with parallel makes

				   12/21
				   -----
support/shlib-install
	- new script to install shared readline and history libraries

shlib/Makefile.in
	- changed to call shlib-install for install and uninstall targets

[readline-4.0-beta1 frozen]

				   12/22
				   -----
configure.in
	- call AC_SUBST for SHOBJ_XLDFLAGS and SHLIB_LIBS

shlib/Makefile.in
	- SHOBJ_XLDFLAGS and SHLIB_LIBS are now substituted by configure
	- add $(SHLIB_LIBS) at end of command line that builds the shared
	  libraries (currently needed only by AIX 4.2)

				   12/31
				   -----
MANIFEST, MANIFEST.doc
	- the TOC html files are no longer generated and no longer part of
	  the distribution

				 2/18/1999
				 ---------
configure.in
	- set MAKE_SHELL to /bin/sh and substitute into the Makefiles

Makefile.in,{doc,examples,shlib}/Makefile.in
	- set SHELL from @MAKE_SHELL@

[readline-4.0 released]

				   3/11
				   ----
doc/Makefile.in
	- removed references to HTMLTOC, since separate HTML table-of-contents
	  files are no longer created

examples/Makefile.in
	- remove `*.exe' in clean target for MS-DOS

Makefile.in
	- make `readline' target depend on ./libreadline.a
	- configure now substitutes TERMCAP_LIB into Makefile.in
	- use ${TERMCAP_LIB} instead of -ltermcap in recipe for `readline'
	- clean target now removes readline and readline.exe in case they
	  get built

configure.in
	- use `pwd.exe' to set BUILD_DIR on MS-DOS DJGPP

				   3/15
				   ----
support/shlib-install
	- Irix 5.x and Irix 6.x should install shared libraries like Solaris 2
	- changes for installing on hp-ux 1[01].x

				   3/23
				   ----
configure.in
	- make sure that the $CC argument to shobj-conf is quoted

				    4/8
				    ---

xmalloc.h, rlprivate.h, rlshell.h
	- new files

Makefile.in,shlib/Makefile.in
	- add dependencies on xmalloc.h, rlshell.h
	- add xmalloc.h, rlprivate.h, rlshell.h to list of header files

MANIFEST
	- add xmalloc.h, rlprivate.h, rlshell.h

				    4/9
				    ---
Makefile.in,shlib/Makefile.in
	- add dependencies on rlprivate.h

				   4/13
				   ----
doc/Makefile.in
	- add variable, PSDVI, which is the desired resolution of the
	  generated postscript files.  Set to 300 because I don't have
	  any 600-dpi printers
	- set LANGUAGE= before calling makeinfo, so messages are in English
	- add rluserman.{info,dvi,ps,html} to appropriate variables
	- add rules to create rluserman.{info,dvi,ps,html}
	- install and uninstall rluserman.info, but don't update the directory
	  file in $(infodir) yet

MANIFEST
	- add doc/rluserman.{texinfo,info,dvi,ps,html}

				   4/30
				   ----
configure.in
	- updated library version to 4.1

				    5/3
				    ---
configure.in
	- SHLIB_MAJOR and SHLIB_MINOR shared library version numbers are
	  constructed from $LIBRARY_VERSION and substituted into Makefiles

				    5/5
				    ---
support/shlib-install
	- OSF/1 installs shared libraries like Solaris

Makefile.in
	- broke the header file install and uninstall into two new targets:
	  install-headers and uninstall-headers
	- install and uninstall depend on install-headers and uninstall-headers
	  respectively
	- changed install-shared and uninstall-shared targets to depend on
	  install-headers and uninstall-headers, respectively, so users may
	  choose to install only the shared libraries.  I'm not sure about
	  the uninstall one yet -- maybe it should check whether or not
	  the static libraries are installed and not remove the header files
	  if they are

				    9/3
				    ---
configure.in, config.h.in
	- added test for memmove (for later use)
	- changed version to 4.1-beta1

	- changes to handle FreeBSD-3.x elf or a.out shared libraries, which
	  have different semantics and need different naming conventions

				 ---------
doc/Makefile.in
	- remove *.bt and *.bts on `make clean'

				    2/4
