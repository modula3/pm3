<H1>showheap</H1>
<P>

The showheap program displays a map of the traced heap of running
Modula-3 program.
<P>

Normally, you should not start showheap directly.  Rather, the runtime
will start showheap and feed it with the proper data when the argument
<B>@M3showheap</B>
is given to a Modula-3 program; for example, to
run the program foo and see the heap of that process, type:
<PRE>
    foo @M3showheap
</PRE>
A Trestle window will appear; when you
click the start button, the program foo will actually start.
<P>

The SRC Modula-3 garbage collector divides the traced heap into pages,
and showheap shows the status of each page controlled by the
collector.  The page size is implementation-dependent.  There are far
more possible page states than can be easily shown, but showheap
colorcodes page states as follows.
<UL>
<LI> Non-heap pages are shown in black.  Any non-heap pages interspersed
with the traced heap were allocated for the untraced heap, or using
lower-level mechanisms.
<P>

<LI> Free pages are shown in white.  Free pages are available for
allocation.
<P>

<LI> Previous-space pages are shown in shades of gray.  These are the
pages that contained objects at the beginning of the current
collection.
<P>

<LI> New-object pages are shown in shades of blue.  These pages contain
objects allocated recently, that have not yet been through a
collection.
<P>

<LI> Copied-object pages are shown in shades of red. These pages contain
objects copied from previous-space pages during this collection.
<P>

<LI> Immobile-object pages are shown in shades of green.  These are like
copied-object pages, but contain objects that could not be moved, such
as objects referenced from thread states; they are left in place by
the collector.
<P>

<LI> Older-generation pages are shown in shades of magenta, when
generational collection is used.  These pages contain objects that
have been through at least one collection, and that needn't be
collected again for a while.
</UL>
<P>

When a program use the showheap facility, a Trestle window is created
at the beginning of the execution.  It shows on the right a map of the
traced heap; this map is a 2D matrix of squares, and each square
represents a page.  Reading this matrix row by row, from left to
right, one finds all that pages in increasing order.  Only the pages
from the first to the last page in the traced heap are displayed (the
other are non-heap pages).
<P>

Most pages can contain multiple objects; larger objects require
multiple pages, and those pages are shown as being connected.
<P>

On the left side of the window, there is legend of the hues used,
together with a count of pages in that state.  The line "gc =
&lt;number&gt;" shows the number of garbage collections since the beginning
of the execution of the program.  The line "off = &lt;number&gt;" is
non-zero iff collection is currently prohibited.
