This package contains the pre-linker tool of the Modula-3 toolkit.
The pre-linker is based on ASTs and computes some additional attributes
defined in the M3AST_PL interface. A tool that wants to operate on
complete programs will find this package indispensible. 

M3LTool         The pre-linker tool
M3LBackEnd      Interface to an (imaginary) linker back end (e.g. ld)
M3LDepends      Computes the "pl_depends_on" attribute
M3LExports      Checks all procedures implemented and opaque types revealed
M3LInitOrder    Computes initialisation order based on "pl_depends_on"
M3LMain         Finds "Main" module(s) in a context
M3LMethodTable  Computes the "pl_method_table" attribute for object types
M3LOpaque       Causes the "current revelation" attribute to be the 
                same as the "concrete" revelation
M3LProgContext  Creates a program context from another context
M3LReveals      Checks consistency of revelations
M3LSubtype      Computes the "pl_subtype_s" attribute
M3LTypeCodes    Computes the "tmp_type_code" attribute for TYPE_SPECs
