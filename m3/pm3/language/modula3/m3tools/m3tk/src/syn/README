This package contains the Modula-3 toolkit parser. It is here that
the decisions on how to represent the lexical entities in the AST
specification are made. Here is a guide to what is (publically)
available:

M3CId           Reveals an M3AST_LX.Symbol_rep, and provides 
                procedures for TEXT <-> M3AST_LX.Symbol_rep mappings.
M3CLiteral      Reveals an M3AST_LX.Literal_rep, and provides 
                procedures for TEXT <-> M3AST_LX.Literal_rep mappings.
M3CParse        The parser interface
M3CPragma       An interface to the pragmas associated with an AST, i.e. 
                M3AST_LX.PragmaStore.
M3CSrcPos       Operations on M3AST_LX.SrcPos values.
