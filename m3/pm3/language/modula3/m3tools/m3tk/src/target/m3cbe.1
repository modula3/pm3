.SH "TARGET MACHINE CONTROL"
.TP
.B \-CCTarget \fItarget\fP
This option alters the target machine to that specified; the default
target is the same as the machine on which the tool is running.
Some semantic error checks are sensitive to the characteristics of the
target machine, for example, \fBLOOPHOLE\fP, which uses information
on the size of types (cf \fBBITSIZE\fP).
