<H1>m3format, pretty printing or checking the indentation of Modula-3 units</H1>
<P>
This program is useful to check if Modula-3 units adhere to the usual
programming conventions (indentation, lower/upper case in identifiers),
and as an example of an application traversing every type of node
contained in the abstract syntax tree.
<P>
It accepts the usual m3tk options for specifying the location of
units (modules, interfaces, generic modules...) and the name of units
to process. Then, options specific to "m3format" specify the
mode of operation, check versus pretty print, and the amount of information
to print. The options are the following:
<DL>
<DT>-Tfile<DD> Read the unit location map from "file". Typically the
location map generated by m3build, .M3IMPTAB, is used.

<DT>file1 file2...<DD> Process the units in the named files. By default
the abstract syntax tree content is printed after the semantic analysis.

<DT>-format .ext<DD> Pretty print the named files and write the output to
file1.ext, file2.ext...

<DT>-check<DD> Check if the named files follow the programming conventions
(default) even if pretty printing is requested with <I>-format</I>.

<DT>-verbose<DD> Print the list of units processed.

<DT>-underscore<DD> Do not complain about underscore characters being used
in identifiers.

</DL>

<P>
Here is a sample usage executed from within the m3format package
on a LINUXELF machine.
