<H1>Sample Applications using the Modula-3 Toolkit Library</H1>
<P>
The applications described here use the Modula-3 Toolkit library
and are representative of typical usage. The m3astcontent program
visits each node of the abstract syntax tree, for the specified Modula-3
files, and prints information as the nodes are traversed. A library
supplied tree walker is used.
<P>
The m3format program performs a depth first search through the abstract
syntax tree and is capable of recreating the text of the source code,
or checking that the programming conventions (upper/lower case for
identifiers, indentation...). An appropriate procedure is used to
search through each type of node.
<P>
Most simple applications can be inspired from m3astcontent. More
involved applications would often benefit from the m3format example.
Finally, the Modula-3 toolkit library contains useful tools for code
analysis based on the rest of the toolkit.
