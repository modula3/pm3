<H1>m3astcontent, printing the content of a Modula-3 Abstract Syntax Tree</H1>
<P>
This program is useful both to understand how abstract syntax trees are
represented in the m3tk library, and how to use the m3tk library for
simple applications.
<P>
It accepts the usual m3tk options for specifying the location of
units (modules, interfaces, generic modules...) and the name of units
to process. Then, options specific to "m3astcontent" specify the
compilations phases to perform before printing the ast. The options
are the following:
<DL>
<DT>-Tfile<DD> Read the unit location map from "file". Typically the
location map generated by m3build, .M3IMPTAB, is used.

<DT>file1 file2...<DD> Process the units in the named files. By default
the abstract syntax tree content is printed after the semantic analysis.

<DT>-parse<DD> Only perform the lexical analysis before printing the
ast.

<DT>-resolve<DD> Only perform the lexical analysis and import/export
resolution before printing the content of the ast.

<DT>-verbose<DD> Print the list of units processed and imported/exported.

</DL>

<P>
Here is a sample usage executed from within the m3astcontent package
on a LINUXELF machine. It takes some time because many units within
the m3tk library have to be processed for the full semantic analysis.
