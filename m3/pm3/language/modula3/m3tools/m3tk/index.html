<H1>The Toolkit for Modula-3 code Parsing and Analysis</H1>
<P>
The Modula-3 toolkit offers a parser, import/export resolver, and
semantic analyzer for Modula-3 units (Module, Interface, Generic Module...).
It also contains a framework for adding tools which work on the abstract
syntax trees (ast) produced by the parser and semantic analyzer. A few
such tools are present in the library.
<P>
A few simple and documented demonstration applications are available
in the tutorial subdirectory. Starting from these together with studying a few
interfaces like M3AST_LX.i3 and M3AST_AS.i3 in subdirectory ast should
be sufficient for helping most users to create new applications based on
the toolkit.
<P>
The Modula-3 toolkit source code is divided in several subdirectories.
The directories gast, ast, and astall respectively describe the generic
data structures and access procedures for the abstract syntax trees,
the Modula-3 specific data structures and access procedures, and the
connection between the two.
<P>
The syn and sem subdirectories produce the parsing and semantic analysis
information in the abstract trees. They are mostly internal to the library.
In files are various interfaces to access files along paths. The misc
subdirectory contains interfaces to manage command line arguments, sort,
process text elements, monitor the elapsed time... In target, the
backend specific constants are computed (anything related to address,
integer, record... size).
<P>
Together toolframe and toolmisc contain the interfaces to register and
call tools in sequence. Typically the front end tool, in subdirectory fe, 
is called first and generates the abstract syntax trees for the
specified files. Then other tools from the library or user supplied
may be called upon to operate on the generated ast. The final output
after executing the registered tools may be messages about the
characteristics of the analyzed units (e.g. source code metrics,
messages about unused variables...), or a modified ast to write out
in binary form using astpickle or to write out as a source code text file
using astdisplay.
<P>
Several tools are included in the library, each in a separate subdirectory.
Asttrans converts non qualified identifier (x with IMPORT x FROM y) 
to fully qualified identifiers (x.y with IMPORT y). Chartool detects any
program section which relies on CHAR being a range of 256 characters
(to see if the program can accept languages with many more characters).
Chkusatool verifies the ast against any missing information, which is
useful for debugging ast transforming tools.
<P>
Deptool performs dependency analysis among program units. Pl performs
the pre-linker tasks such as verifying that the program is complete and
all the opaque types revealed, and computing the initialization order.
Warntool reports implicit NARROW, uncaught exceptions, missing RETURN and
unused declarations.
