This is a modified version of m3pp that supports PostScript output.
It uses a version of Formatter (called NewFormatter) that uses REALs
instead of INTEGERs for all the widths, and which has a replaceable
backend.  The current backends support ordinary ASCII text and PostScript.

With the PostScript backend, m3pp supports pretty-printing with multiple
fonts for various language components (keywords, comments, etc.) but using
the actual PostScript font widths to make formatting decisions.

To install this, edit FBEPostScript.m3 and change the definition of AFMDir
to point to whereever you have your font metric files for PostScript fonts.
If you have Transcript from Adobe, it should have such a directory.  Then
compile ("m3make y.tab.c lex.yy.c; m3make") and you're ready to go.  Like
the released version of m3pp, this one requires either bison or a version
of yacc modified to have larger internal tables.

If you have any questions, bug reports, bug fixes, or enhancements, drop me
a note at nichols@parc.xerox.com.
