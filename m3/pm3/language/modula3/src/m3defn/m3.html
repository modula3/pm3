<H1> Modula-3: Language definition </H1>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
The language designer should be familiar with many alternative  
features designed by others, and should have excellent judgment in  
choosing the best and rejecting any that are mutually inconsistent...  
One thing he should not do is to include untried ideas of his own.  
His task is consolidation, not innovation.  
---C.A.R. Hoare

The original definition of Modula-3 was given in
<A HREF="../../modula-3/html/bib.html#m3-CDG*88">SRC Research Report 31</A>,
August 1988.
It was revised in
<A HREF="../../modula-3/html/bib.html#m3-CDG*89">report 52</A>,
November 1989.
And finally published in
<A HREF="../../modula-3/html/bib.html#SPwM3">Systems Programming with Modula-3</A>, November 1989.
This edition of the language definition is derived from all of the above.
