<H1>Variables</H1>
<P>

If <TT>id</TT> is an identifier, <TT>T</TT> a non-empty type other than 
an open array type, and <TT>E</TT> an expression, then:
<PRE>
    VAR id: T := E
</PRE>
<P>declares <TT>id</TT> as a variable of type <TT>T</TT> whose initial value 
is the value of <TT>E</TT>.  Either "<TT>:= E</TT>" or "<TT>: T</TT>" 
can be omitted, but not both.  If <TT>T</TT> is omitted, it is taken 
to be the type of <TT>E</TT>.  If <TT>E</TT> is omitted, the initial value 
is an arbitrary value of type <TT>T</TT>.  If both are present, <TT>
E</TT> must be assignable to <TT>T</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.124>The</A>
initial value is a shorthand that is equivalent to inserting the
assignment <TT>id := E</TT> at the beginning of the executable
part of the block.
If several variables have initial values, their assignments are inserted
in the order they are declared.  For example:
<PRE>
    VAR i: [0..5] := j; j: [0..5] := i; BEGIN S END
</PRE>	
<P>initializes <TT>i</TT> and <TT>j</TT> to the same arbitrary value
in <TT>[0..5]</TT>; 
it is equivalent to:
<PRE>
    VAR i: [0..5]; j: [0..5]; BEGIN i := j; j := i; S END
</PRE>	

<P>If a sequence of identifiers share the same type and initial value,
<TT>id</TT> can be a list of identifiers separated by commas.  Such
a list is shorthand for a list in which the type and
initial value are repeated for each identifier.
That is:
<PRE>
    VAR v_1, ..., v_n: T := E
</PRE>	
<P>is shorthand for:
<PRE>
    VAR v_1: T := E; ...; VAR v_n: T := E
</PRE>	
<P>This means that <TT>E</TT> is evaluated <TT>n</TT> times.
