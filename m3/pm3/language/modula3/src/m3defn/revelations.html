<H2>Revelations</H2>
<P>

A <EM>revelation</EM> introduces information about an opaque type into
a scope.  Unlike other declarations, revelations introduce no new names.
<P>

There are two kinds of revelations, <EM>partial</EM> and <EM>complete</EM>.
A program can contain any number of partial revelations for an opaque
type; it must contain exactly one complete revelation.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.131>A</A> partial revelation has the form:
<PRE>
    REVEAL T &lt;: V
</PRE>
where <TT>V</TT> is a type expression (possibly just a name)
and <TT>T</TT> is an identifier (possibly
<A HREF="imports.html#idx.139">qualified</A>)
declared as an opaque type.  It reveals that
<TT>V</TT> is a supertype of <TT>T</TT>.
<P>

In any scope, the revealed supertypes of an opaque type must be linearly
ordered by the subtype relation.
That is, if it is revealed that <TT>T &lt;: U1</TT> and <TT>T &lt;: U2</TT>,
it must also be revealed either that
<TT>U1 &lt;: U2</TT> or that <TT>U2 &lt;: U1</TT>.
<P>

A complete revelation has the form:
<PRE>
    REVEAL T = V
</PRE>
where <TT>V</TT> is a type expression (not just a name) whose outermost
type constructor is a branded reference or object type and <TT>T</TT>
is an identifier (possibly qualified) that has been declared as an
opaque type.  The revelation specifies that <TT>V</TT> is the concrete
type for <TT>T</TT>. It is a static error if any type revealed in any
scope as a supertype of <TT>T</TT> is not a supertype of <TT>V</TT>.
Generally this error is detected at link time.
<P>

Distinct opaque types have distinct concrete types, since <TT>V</TT>
includes a brand and all brands in a program are distinct.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.132>A</A>
revelation is allowed only in an interface or in the outermost scope
of a module.  A revelation in an interface can be imported into any
scope where it is required, as illustrated by the
<A HREF="example.html">stack example</A>.
<P>

For example, consider:
<PRE>
    INTERFACE I; TYPE T &lt;: ROOT; PROCEDURE P(x:T): T; END I.

    INTERFACE IClass; IMPORT I; REVEAL I.T &lt;: MUTEX; END IClass.

    INTERFACE IRep; IMPORT I;
      REVEAL I.T = MUTEX BRANDED OBJECT count: INTEGER END;
    END IRep.
</PRE>  
An importer of <TT>I</TT> sees <TT>I.T</TT> as an opaque subtype of
<TT>ROOT</TT>, and is limited to allocating objects of type <TT>I.T</TT>,
passing them to <TT>I.P</TT>, or declaring subtypes of <TT>I.T</TT>.
An importer of <TT>IClass</TT> sees that every <TT>I.T</TT> is a
<TT>MUTEX</TT>, and can therefore lock objects of type <TT>I.T</TT>.
Finally, an importer of <TT>IRep</TT> sees the concrete type,
and can access the <TT>count</TT> field.
