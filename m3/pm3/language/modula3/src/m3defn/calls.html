<H2>Procedure calls</H2>
<P>

A procedure call has the form:
<PRE>
    P(Bindings)
</PRE>
where <TT>P</TT> is a procedure-valued expression and <TT>Bindings</TT> 
is a list of <EM>keyword</EM> or <EM>positional</EM> bindings. A keyword 
binding has the form <TT>name := actual</TT>, where <TT>actual</TT> is 
an expression and <TT>name</TT> is an identifier.  A positional binding 
has the form <TT>actual</TT>, where <TT>actual</TT> is an expression.  
When keyword and positional bindings are mixed in a call, the 
positional bindings must precede the keyword bindings.  If the list 
of bindings is empty, the parentheses are still required.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.85>The</A>
list of bindings is rewritten to fit the signature of <TT>P</TT>'s
type as follows:  First, each positional binding <TT>actual</TT> is
converted and added to the list of keyword bindings by supplying the
name of the <TT>i</TT>'th formal parameter, where <TT>actual</TT> is the
<TT>i</TT>'th binding in <TT>Bindings</TT>.  Second, for each parameter that
has a default and is not bound after the first step,
the binding <TT>name := default</TT> is added to the list of bindings,
where <TT>name</TT>
is the name of the parameter and <TT>default</TT> is its default value.
The rewritten list of bindings must bind only formal parameters and 
must bind each formal parameter exactly once.
For example, suppose that the type of <TT>P</TT> is
<PRE>
    PROCEDURE(ch: CHAR; n: INTEGER := 0)
</PRE>
Then the following calls are all equivalent: 
<PRE>
    P('a', 0)
    P('a')
    P(ch := 'a')
    P(n := 0, ch := 'a')
    P('a', n := 0)
</PRE>
The call <TT>P()</TT> is illegal, since it doesn't bind
<TT>ch</TT>.  The call <TT>P(n := 0, 'a')</TT> is illegal, since it has
a keyword parameter before a positional parameter.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.86>For</A>
a <TT>READONLY</TT> or <TT>VALUE</TT> parameter, the actual can be 
any expression assignable to the type of the formal (except that 
the prohibition against assigning local procedures is relaxed). For 
a <TT>VAR</TT> parameter, the actual must be a
<A HREF="designators.html">writable designator</A> whose 
type is the same as that of the formal, or, in case of a <TT>VAR</TT> 
array parameter, assignable to that of the formal.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.87>A</A>
<TT>VAR</TT> formal is bound to the variable designated by the 
corresponding actual; that is, it is aliased.  A <TT>VALUE</TT> formal 
is bound to a variable with an unused location and initialized to 
the value of the corresponding actual.  A <TT>READONLY</TT> formal is 
treated as a <TT>VAR</TT> formal if the actual is a designator and the 
type of the actual is the same as the type of the formal (or an array 
type that is assignable to the type of the formal); otherwise 
it is treated as a <TT>VALUE</TT> formal.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.88>Implementations</A>
are allowed to forbid <TT>VAR</TT> or <TT>READONLY</TT> 
parameters of packed types.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.89>To</A>
execute the call, the procedure <TT>P</TT> and its arguments are 
evaluated, the formal parameters are bound, and the body of the 
procedure is executed.  The order of evaluation of <TT>P</TT> and its 
actual arguments is undefined.  It is a checked runtime error to 
call an undefined or <TT>NIL</TT> procedure.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.90>It</A>
is a checked runtime error for a procedure to raise an exception 
not included in its raises set (If an implementation 
maps this runtime error into an exception, the exception is implicitly 
included in all <TT>RAISES</TT> clauses.) or for a function procedure 
to fail to return a result.
<P>

A procedure call is a statement only if the procedure is proper.  To
call a function procedure and discard its result, use
<A HREF="eval.html"><TT>EVAL</TT></A>.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.91>A</A>
procedure call can also have the form:
<PRE>
    o.m(Bindings)
</PRE>
where <TT>o</TT> is an object and <TT>m</TT> names one of
<TT>o</TT>'s methods.  This is equivalent to:
<PRE>
    (o's m method) (o, Bindings)
</PRE>
<P>
