<H1>Opaque types</H1>
<P>

An <EM>opaque type</EM> is a name that denotes an unknown subtype of some
given reference type.  For example, an opaque subtype of <TT>REFANY</TT> is
an unknown traced reference type; an opaque subtype of
<TT>UNTRACED ROOT</TT>
is an unknown untraced object type.  The actual type denoted by an
opaque type name is called its <EM>concrete type</EM>.
<P>

Different scopes can reveal different information about an opaque type.
For example, what is known in one scope only to be a subtype of <TT>REFANY</TT>
could be known in another scope to be a subtype of <TT>ROOT</TT>.
<P>

An opaque type declaration has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPE T &lt;: U
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>T</TT> is an identifier and <TT>U</TT> an expression denoting a
reference type.  It introduces the name <TT>T</TT> as an opaque type and
reveals that <TT>U</TT> is a supertype of <TT>T</TT>. The concrete type of
<TT>T</TT> must be revealed elsewhere in the program.
