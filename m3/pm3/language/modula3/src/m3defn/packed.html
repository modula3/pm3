<H1>Packed types</H1>
<P>

A declaration of a packed type has the form:
<PRE>
    TYPE T = BITS n FOR Base
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>Base</TT> is a type and <TT>n</TT> is an integer-valued constant 
expression. The values of type <TT>T</TT> are the same as the values 
of type <TT>Base</TT>, but variables of type <TT>T</TT> that occur in 
records, objects, or arrays will occupy exactly <TT>n</TT> bits and 
be packed adjacent to the preceding field or element.  For example, 
a variable of type
<PRE>
    ARRAY [0..255] OF BITS 1 FOR BOOLEAN
</PRE>
<P>is an array of 256 booleans, each of which occupies one bit of storage.
<P>

The values allowed for <TT>n</TT> are implementation-dependent.  An 
illegal value for <TT>n</TT> is a static error.  The legality of a packed 
type can depend on its context; for example, an implementation could 
prohibit packed integers from spanning word boundaries.
