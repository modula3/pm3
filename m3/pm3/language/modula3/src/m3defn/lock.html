<H2>Lock</H2>
<P>

A <TT>LOCK</TT> statement has the form: 
<PRE>
    LOCK mu DO S END
</PRE>
where <TT>S</TT> is a statement and <TT>mu</TT> is an expression.
It is equivalent to:
<PRE>
    WITH m = mu DO
      <A HREF="thread-intf.html">Thread</A>.Acquire(m);
      TRY S FINALLY Thread.Release(m) END
    END
</PRE>
where <TT>m</TT> stands for a variable that does not occur in <TT>S</TT>.
<P>
