<H1>Required interfaces</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>
C++ has a host of operators that will be explained if and where needed.  
---The C++ Programming Language
</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<A NAME=idx.222>There</A>
are several fundamental interfaces that every
Modula-3 implementation must provide:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>    <A HREF="text-intf.html"><TT>Text</TT></A> provides operations
    on text strings.
    <P>

    <A HREF="thread-intf.html"><TT>Thread</TT></A> provides synchronization
    primitives for multiple threads of control.
    <P>

    <A HREF="word-intf.html"><TT>Word</TT></A> provides operations on
    unsigned words.
    <P>

    <A HREF="real-intf.html"><TT>Real</TT>, <TT>LongReal</TT>,
    and <TT>ExtendedReal</TT></A>
    define the properties of the three floating point types;
    for example, their bases and ranges.
    <P>

    <A HREF="float-intf.html"><TT>RealFloat</TT>, <TT>LongFloat</TT>,
    and <TT>ExtendedFloat</TT></A>
    provide numerical operations related to the
    floating-point representation; for example, extracting the exponent
    of a number.
    <P>

    <A HREF="floatmode.html"><TT>FloatMode</TT></A> provides operations
    for testing (and possibly setting) the behavior of the implementation
    in response to numeric conditions; for example, overflow.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Implementations are free to extend the required interfaces, provided
they do not invalidate clients of the unextended interfaces.
