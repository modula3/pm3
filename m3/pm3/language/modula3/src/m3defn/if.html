<H2>If</H2>
<P>

An <TT>IF</TT> statement has the form:
<PRE>
    IF    B_1 THEN S_1
    ELSIF B_2 THEN S_2
      ...
    ELSIF B_n THEN S_n
    ELSE S_0
    END
</PRE>
<P>

where the <TT>B</TT>'s are boolean expressions and the <TT>S</TT>'s are 
statements.  The "<TT>ELSE S_0</TT>" and each
"<TT>ELSIF B_i THEN S_i</TT>" are optional.
<P>

The statement evaluates the <TT>B</TT>'s in order until some
<TT>B_i</TT> evaluates to <TT>TRUE</TT>, and then executes <TT>S_i</TT>.
If none of the expressions evaluates to <TT>TRUE</TT> and
"<TT>ELSE S_0</TT>" is present, <TT>S_0</TT> is executed.
If none of the expressions evaluates 
to <TT>TRUE</TT> and "<TT>ELSE S_0</TT>" is absent, the statement 
is a no-op (except for any side-effects of the <TT>B</TT>'s).
<P>
