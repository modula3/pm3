<H3><A NAME="idx.0">History</A></H3>
<P>

On November 6th, 1986, Maurice Wilkes wrote to Niklaus Wirth proposing
that the Modula-2+ language be revised and standardized as a successor
to Modula-2.  Wirth gave this project his blessing, and the Modula-3
committee was born.
<P>

At the first meeting, the committee unanimously agreed to be true to
the spirit of Modula-2 by selecting simple, safe, proven features rather
than experimenting with our own untried ideas.  We found that unanimity
was harder to achieve when we got to the details.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.1">Modula-3</A>
supports interfaces, objects, generics, lightweight threads
of control, the isolation of unsafe code, garbage collection,
exceptions, and subtyping.  Some of the more problematical features
of Modula-2 have been removed, like variant records and the built-in
unsigned numeric data type.  Modula-3 is substantially simpler than other
languages with comparable power.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.2">Modula-3</A>
is closely based on Modula-2+, which was designed at the
Digital Equipment Corporation Systems Research Center and used to build
the Topaz system
[<A HREF="../../modula-3/html/bib.html#mcjones89">McJones89</A>,
<A HREF="../../modula-3/html/bib.html#rovner86">Rovner86</A>].
The Modula-3 design was
a joint project by Digital and Olivetti.  The language definition was
published in August 1988, and immediately followed by implementation
efforts at both companies.  In January 1989, the committee revised
the language to reflect the experiences of these implementation teams.
A few final revisions were made for the publication of this book.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.3">SRC Modula-3</A>
is distributed by the DEC Systems Research Center under a liberal license.
The <A HREF="../../modula-3/html/install.html">distribution</A>
includes a compiler for Modula-3, the Modula-3 Abstract Syntax Tree
toolkit developed at Olivetti, and a runtime system with configuration
files for DEC, IBM, HP, and Sun workstations.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="idx.4">Perspective</A></H3>
<P>

Most systems programming today is done in the BCPL family of languages,
which includes B, Bliss, and C. The beauty of these languages is the
modest cost with which they were able to take a great leap
forward from assembly language.  To fully appreciate them, you must
consider the engineering constraints of machines in the 1960s.  What
language designed in the 1980s has a compiler that fits into four
thousand 18-bit words, like Ken Thompson's B compiler for the PDP-7?
The most successful of these languages was C, which by the early 1970s
had almost completely displaced assembly language in the Unix system.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.5">The</A> BCPL-like languages are easy
to implement efficiently for the same reason they are attractive to
skeptical assembly language programmers: they present a programming
model that is close to the target machine.  Pointers are identified
with arrays, and address arithmetic is ubiquitous.  Unfortunately, this
low-level programming model is inherently dangerous.  Many errors are
as disastrous as they would be in machine language.  The type system
is scanty, and reveals enough quirks of the target machine that even
experienced and disciplined programmers sometimes write unportable
code simply by accident.  The most modern language in this family,
C++, has enriched C by adding objects; but it has also given up C's
best virtue---simplicity---without relieving C's worst drawback---its
low-level programming model. 
<P>

<A NAME="idx.6">At</A>
the other extreme are languages like Lisp, ML, Smalltalk, and CLU,
whose programming models originate from mathematics.  Lisp is the hybrid
of the lambda calculus and the theory of a pairing function; ML stems
from polymorphic type theory; Smalltalk from a theory of objects and
inheritance; CLU from a theory of abstract data types.  These languages
have beautiful programming models, but they tend to be difficult to
implement efficiently, because the uniform treatment of values in the
programming model invites a runtime system in which values are uniformly
represented by pointers.  If the implementer doesn't take steps to
avoid it, as simple a statement as <TT>n := n + 1</TT> could require an
allocation, a method lookup, or both.  Good implementations avoid
most of the cost, and languages in this family have been used
successfully for systems programming.  But their general disposition
towards heap allocation rather than stack allocation remains, and they
have not become popular with systems programmers.  The runtime systems
required to make these languages efficient often isolate them in closed
environments that cannot accommodate programs written in other
languages.  If you are a fan of these languages you may find Modula-3
overly pragmatic; but read on anyway, and give us a chance to show
that pragmatic constraints do not exclude attractive solutions.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.7">Between</A>
the extremes of BCPL and Lisp is the Algol family of languages,
whose modern representatives include Pascal, Ada, Modula-2, and
Modula-3.  These languages have programming models that reflect the
engineering constraints of random-access machines but conceal the
details of any particular machine.  They give up the beauty and
mathematical symmetry of the Lisp family in order to make efficient
implementations possible without special tricks; they also have strong
type systems that avoid most of the dangerous and machine-dependent
features of the BCPL family.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.8">In</A>
the 1960s, the trend in the Algol family was toward features for
control flow and data structuring.  In the 1970s, the trend was toward
information-hiding features like interfaces, opaque types, and generics.
More recently, the trend in the Algol family has been to adopt a careful
selection of techniques from the Lisp and BCPL families.  This trend
is demonstrated by Modula-3, Oberon, and Cedar, to name three languages
that have floated portable implementations in the last few years.
<P>

Modula-3, Oberon, and Cedar all provide garbage collection, previously
viewed as a luxury available only in the closed runtime systems of
the Lisp family.  But the world is starting to understand that garbage
collection is the only way to achieve an adequate level of safety,
and that modern garbage collectors can work in open runtime
environments.
<P>

At the same time, these three languages allow a small set of unsafe,
machine-dependent operations of the sort usually associated with the
BCPL family.  In Modula-3, unsafe operations are allowed only in modules
explicitly labeled unsafe.  The combination of garbage collection with
the explicit isolation of unsafe features produces a language suitable
for programming entire systems from the highest-level applications
down to the lowest-level device drivers.
<P>

<H3>Features</H3>
<P>

The remainder of the introduction is an overview of the most important
features of Modula-3.  
<P>

<H4><A NAME="idx.9">Interfaces</A></H4>
<P>

One of Modula-2's most successful features is the provision for explicit
interfaces between modules.  Interfaces are retained with essentially
no changes in Modula-3.  An interface to a module is a collection of
declarations that reveal the public parts of a module; things in the
module that are not declared in the interface are private.  A module
<EM>imports</EM> the interfaces it depends on and <EM>exports</EM> the
interface (or, in Modula-3, the interfaces) that it implements.
<P>

Interfaces make separate compilation type-safe; but it does them an
injustice to look at them in such a limited way.  Interfaces make it
possible to think about large systems without holding the whole system
in your head at once.
<P>

Programmers who have never used Modula-style interfaces tend to
underestimate them, observing, for example, that anything that can
be done with interfaces can also be done with C-style include files.
This misses the point: many things can be done with include files that
cannot be done with interfaces.  For example, the meaning of an include
file can be changed by defining macros in the environment into which
it is included.  Include files tempt programmers into shortcuts across
abstraction boundaries.  To keep large programs well structured, you
either need super-human will power, or proper language support for
interfaces.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="idx.10">Objects</A></H4>
<P>

THe better we understand our programs, the bigger the building blocks
we use to structure them.  After the instruction came the statement,
after the statement came the procedure, after the procedure came the
interface.  The next step seems to be the <EM>abstract type</EM>.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.11">At</A>
the theoretical level, an abstract type is a type defined by the
specifications of its operations instead of by the representation of
its data.  As realized in modern programming languages, a value of
an abstract type is represented by an "object" whose operations are
implemented by a suite of procedure values called the object's
"methods".  A new object type can be defined as a <EM>subtype</EM> of
an existing type, in which case the new type has all the methods of
the old type, and possibly new ones as well (inheritance).  The new
type can provide new implementations for the old methods (overriding).
<P>

Objects were invented in the mid-sixties by the farsighted designers
of Simula
[<A HREF="../../modula-3/html/bib.html#birtwistle">Birtwistle</A>].
Objects in Modula-3 are very much like
objects in Simula: they are always references, they have both data
fields and methods, and they have single inheritance but not multiple
inheritance.
<P>

Small examples are often used to get across the basic idea: truck as
a subtype of vehicle; rectangle as a subtype of polygon.  Modula-3
aims at larger systems that illustrate how object types provide
structure for large programs.  In Modula-3 the main design
effort is concentrated into specifying the properties of a single
abstract type---a stream of characters, a window on the screen.  Then
dozens of interfaces and modules are coded that provide useful subtypes
of the central abstraction.  The abstract type provides the blueprint
for a whole family of interfaces and modules.  If the central
abstraction is well-designed then useful subtypes can be produced
easily, and the original design cost will be repaid with interest.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.12">The</A>
combination of object types with Modula-2 opaque types produces
something new: the <EM>partially opaque type</EM>, where some of an
object's fields are visible in a scope and others are hidden.  Because
the committee had no experience with partially opaque types, the first
version of Modula-3 restricted them severely; but after a year of
experience it was clear that they were a good thing, and the language
was revised to remove the restrictions.
<P>

It is possible to use object-oriented techniques even in languages
that were not designed to support them, by explicitly allocating the
data records and method suites.  This approach works reasonably smoothly
when there are no subtypes; however it is through subtyping that
object-oriented techniques offer the most leverage.  The approach works
badly when subtyping is needed: either you allocate the data records
for the different parts of the object individually (which is expensive
and notationally cumbersome) or you must rely on unchecked type
transfers, which is unsafe.  Whichever approach is taken, the subtype
relations are all in the programmer's head: only with an object-oriented
language is it possible to get object-oriented static typechecking.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="idx.13">Generics</A></H4>
<P>

A generic module is a template in which some of the imported interfaces
are regarded as formal parameters, to be bound to actual interfaces
when the generic is instantiated.  For example, a generic hash table
module could be instantiated to produce tables of integers, tables
of text strings, or tables of any desired type.  The different generic
instances are compiled independently: the source program is reused,
but the compiled code will generally be different for different
instances.
<P>

To keep Modula-3 generics simple, they are confined to the module level:
generic procedures and types do not exist in isolation, and generic
parameters must be entire interfaces.
<P>

In the same spirit of simplicity, there is no separate typechecking
associated with generics.  Implementations are expected to expand the
generic and typecheck the result.  The alternative would be to invent
a polymorphic type system flexible enough to express the constraints
on the parameter interfaces that are necessary in order for the generic
body to compile.  This has been achieved for ML and CLU, but it has
not yet been achieved satisfactorily in the Algol family of languages,
where the type systems are less uniform.  (The rules associated with
Ada generics are too complicated for our taste.)
<P>

<H4><A NAME="idx.14">Threads</A></H4>
<P>

Dividing a computation into concurrent processes (or threads of control)
is a fundamental method of separating concerns.  For example, suppose
you are programming a terminal emulator with a blinking cursor: the
most satisfactory way to separate the cursor blinking code from the
rest of the program is to make it a separate thread.  Or suppose you
are augmenting a program with a new module that communicates over a
buffered channel.  Without threads, the rest of the program will be
blocked whenever the new module blocks on its buffer, and conversely,
the new module will be unable to service the buffer whenever any other
part of the program blocks.  If this is unacceptable (as it almost
always is) there is no way to add the new module without finding and
modifying every statement of the program that might block.  These
modifications destroy the structure of the program by introducing
undesirable dependencies between what would otherwise be independent
modules.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.15">The</A>
provisions for threads in Modula-2 are weak, amounting essentially
to coroutines.  Hoare's monitors
[<A HREF="../../modula-3/html/bib.html#hoare">Hoare</A>]
are a sounder basis for
concurrent programming.  Monitors were used in Mesa, where they worked
well; except that the requirement that a monitored data structure be
an entire module was irksome.  For example, it is often useful for
a monitored data structure to be an object instead of a module.  Mesa
relaxed this requirement, made a slight change in the details of the
semantics of Hoare's <TT>Signal</TT> primitive, and introduced the
<TT>Broadcast</TT> primitive as a convenience
[<A HREF="../../modula-3/html/bib.html#lampson80">Lampson</A>].
The Mesa primitives were simplified in the Modula-2+ design, and the result
was successful enough to be incorporated with no substantial changes
in Modula-3.
<P>

<A NAME="idx.16">A</A>
threads package is a tool with a very sharp edge.  A common
programming error is to access a shared variable without obtaining
the necessary lock.  This introduces a race condition that can lie
dormant throughout testing and strike after the program is shipped.
Theoretical work on process algebra has raised hopes that the rendezvous
model of concurrency may be safer than the shared memory model, but
the experience with Ada, which adopted the rendezvous, lends at best
equivocal support for this hope---Ada still allows shared variables,
and apparently they are widely used.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="idx.17">Safety</A></H4>
<P>

A language feature is <EM>unsafe</EM> if its misuse can corrupt the runtime
system so that further execution of the program is not faithful to
the language semantics.  An example of an unsafe feature is array
assignment without bounds checking: if the index is out of bounds,
then an arbitrary location can be clobbered and the address space can
become fatally corrupted.  An error in a safe program can cause the
computation to abort with a run-time error message or to give the wrong
answer, but it can't cause the computation to crash in a rubble of
bits.
<P>

Safe programs can share the same address space, each safe from
corruption by errors in the others.  To get similar protection for
unsafe programs requires placing them in separate address spaces.  As
large address spaces become available, and programmers use them to
produce tightly-coupled applications, safety becomes more and more
important.
<P>

Unfortunately, it is generally impossible to program the lowest levels of
a system with complete safety.  Neither the compiler nor the runtime
system can check the validity of a bus address for an I/O controller,
nor can they limit the ensuing havoc if it is invalid.  This presents
the language designer with a dilemma.  If he holds out for safety,
then low level code will have to be programmed in another language.
But if he adopts unsafe features, then his safety guarantee becomes
void everywhere.  
<P>

The languages of the BCPL family are full of unsafe features;
the languages of the Lisp family generally have none (or none that
are documented).  In this area Modula-3 follows the lead of Cedar by
adopting a small number of <A HREF="unsafe.html">unsafe features</A>
that are allowed only in
modules explicitly labeled unsafe.  In a safe module, the compiler
prevents any errors that could corrupt the runtime system; in an unsafe
module, it is the programmer's responsibility to avoid them.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="idx.18">Garbage Collection</A></H4>
<P>

A classic unsafe runtime error is to free a data structure that is
still reachable by active references (or "dangling pointers").  The
error plants a time bomb that explodes later, when the storage is
reused.  If on the other hand the programmer fails to free records
that have become unreachable, the result will be a "storage leak"
and the computation space will grow without bound.  Problems due to
dangling pointers and storage leaks tend to persist long after other
errors have been found and removed.  The only sure way to avoid
these problems is the automatic freeing of unreachable storage, or
garbage collection.
<P>

Modula-3 therefore provides "traced references", which are like
Modula-2 pointers except that the storage they point to is kept in
the "traced heap" where it will be freed automatically when all
references to it are gone.
<P>

Another great benefit of garbage collection is that it simplifies
interfaces.  Without garbage collection, an interface must specify
whether the client or the implementation has the responsibility for
freeing each allocated reference, and the conditions under which it
is safe to do so.  This can swamp the interface in complexity.  For
example, Modula-3 supports text strings by a simple required interface
<TT>Text</TT>, rather than with a built-in type.  Without garbage
collection, this approach would not be nearly as attractive.
<P>

New refinements in garbage collection have appeared continually for
more than twenty years, but it is still difficult to implement
efficiently.  For many programs, the programming time saved by
simplifying interfaces and eliminating storage leaks and dangling
pointers makes garbage collection a bargain, but the lowest levels
of a system may not be able to afford it.  For example, in SRC's Topaz
system, the part of the operating system that manages files and
heavy-weight processes relies on garbage collection, but the inner
"nub" that implements virtual memory and thread context switching
does not.  Essentially all Topaz application programs rely on garbage
collection.
<P>

For programs that cannot afford garbage collection, Modula-3 provides
a set of reference types that are not traced by the garbage collector.
In most other respects, traced and untraced references behave
identically.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="idx.19">Exceptions</A></H4>
<P>

An exception is a control construct that exits many scopes at once.
Raising an exception exits active scopes repeatedly until a handler
is found for the exception, and transfers control to the handler.  If
there is no handler, the computation terminates in some system-dependent
way---for example, by entering the debugger.
<P>

There are many arguments for and against exceptions, most of which
revolve around inconclusive issues of style and taste.  One argument
in their favor that has the weight of experience behind it is that
exceptions are a good way to handle any runtime error that is usually,
but not necessarily, fatal.  If exceptions are not available, each
procedure that might encounter a runtime error must return an additional
code to the caller to identify whether an error has occurred.  This
can be clumsy, and has the practical drawback that even careful
programmers may inadvertently omit the test for the error return code.
The frequency with which returned error codes are ignored has become
something of a standing joke in the Unix/C world.  Raising an exception
is more robust, since it stops the program unless there is an explicit
handler for it.
<P>

<H4>Type system</H4>
<P>

Like all languages in the Algol family, Modula-3 is strongly typed.
The basic idea of strong typing is to partition the value space into
types, restrict variables to hold values of a single type, and restrict
operations to apply to operands of fixed types.  In actuality, strong
typing is rarely so simple.  For example, each of the following
complications is present in at least one language of the Algol family:
a variable of type <TT>[0..9]</TT> may be safely assigned to an
<TT>INTEGER</TT>, but not vice-versa (subtyping).  Operations like absolute
value may apply both to <TT>REAL</TT>s and to <TT>INTEGER</TT>s instead of
to a single type (overloading).  The types of literals (for example,
<TT>NIL</TT>) can be ambiguous.  The type of an expression may be
determined by how it is used (target-typing).  Type mismatches may
cause automatic conversions instead of errors (as when a fractional
real is rounded upon assignment to an integer).
<P>

We adopted several principles in order to make Modula-3's type system
as uniform as possible.  First, there are no ambiguous types or
target-typing: the type of every expression is determined by its
subexpressions, not by its use.  Second, there are no automatic
conversions.  In some cases the <EM>representation</EM> of a value changes
when it is assigned (for example, when assigning to a packed field
of a record type) but the abstract value itself is transferred without
change.  Third, the rules for type compatibility are defined in terms
of a single subtype relation.  The subtype relation is required for
treating objects with inheritance, but it is also useful for defining
the type compatibility rules for conventional types.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="idx.20">Simplicity</A></H4>
<P>

In the early days of the Ada project, a general in the Ada Program
Office opined that "obviously the Department of Defense is not
interested in an artificially simplified language such as Pascal".
Modula-3 represents the opposite point of view.  We used every artifice
that we could find or invent to make the language simple.
<P>

C. A. R. Hoare has suggested that as a rule of thumb a language is
too complicated if it can't be described precisely and readably in
fifty pages.  The Modula-3 committee elevated this to a design
principle: we gave ourselves a "complexity budget" of fifty pages,
and chose the most useful features that we could accommodate within
this budget.  In the end, we were over budget by six lines plus the
syntax equations.  This policy is a bit arbitrary, but there are so
many good ideas in programming language design that some kind of
arbitrary budget seems necessary to keep a language from getting too
complicated.
<P>

In retrospect, the features that made the cut were directed toward
two main goals.  Interfaces, objects, generics, and threads provide
fundamental patterns of abstraction that help to structure large
programs.  The isolation of unsafe code, garbage collection, and
exceptions help make programs safer and more robust.  Of the techniques
that we used to keep the language internally consistent, the most
important was the definition of a clean type system based on a subtype
relation.  There is no special novelty in any one of these features
individually, but there is simplicity and power in their combination.
