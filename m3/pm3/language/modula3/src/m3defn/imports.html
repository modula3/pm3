<H1>Import statements</H1>
<P>

There are two forms of import statements.  All imports of both forms
are interpreted simultaneously: their order doesn't matter.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.139>
The first form is
</A>
<PRE>
    IMPORT I AS J
</PRE>
<P>which imports the interface whose global name is <TT>I</TT> and gives
it the local name <TT>J</TT>. The entities and revelations declared in
<TT>I</TT> become accessible in the importing module or interface, but
the entities and revelations imported into <TT>I</TT> do not.  To refer
to the entity declared with name <TT>N</TT> in the interface <TT>I</TT>,
the importer must use the <EM>qualified identifier</EM> <TT>J.N</TT>.
<P>

The statement <TT>IMPORT I</TT> is short for <TT>IMPORT I AS I</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.140>The</A>
second form is
<PRE>
    FROM I IMPORT N
</PRE>
<P>which introduces <TT>N</TT> as the local name for the entity declared
as <TT>N</TT> in the interface <TT>I</TT>.
A local binding for <TT>I</TT> takes
precedence over a global binding.
For example,
<PRE>
    IMPORT I AS J, J AS I; FROM I IMPORT N
</PRE>
<P>simultaneously introduces local names <TT>J</TT>, <TT>I</TT>, and <TT>N</TT>
for the entities whose global names are <TT>I</TT>, <TT>J</TT>,
and <TT>J.N</TT>, respectively.
<P>

It is illegal to use the same local name twice:
<PRE>
    IMPORT J AS I, K AS I;
</PRE>
<P>is a static error, even if <TT>J</TT> and <TT>K</TT> are the same.
