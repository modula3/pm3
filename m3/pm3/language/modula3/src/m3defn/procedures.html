<H1>Procedures</H1>
<P>

There are two forms of procedure declaration:
<PRE>
    PROCEDURE id sig = B id

    PROCEDURE id sig
</PRE>
<P><A NAME=idx.126>where</A>
<TT>id</TT> is an identifier, <TT>sig</TT> is a procedure signature, and
<TT>B</TT> is a block.  In both cases, the type of <TT>id</TT> is the procedure
type determined by <TT>sig</TT>.  The first form is allowed only in 
modules; the second form is allowed only in interfaces.
<P>

<A NAME=idx.127>The</A>
first form declares <TT>id</TT> as a procedure constant whose signature
is <TT>sig</TT>, whose body is <TT>B</TT>, and whose environment is the scope
containing the declaration.  The parameter names are treated as if
they were declared at the outer level of <TT>B</TT>; the parameter types
and default values are evaluated in the scope containing the procedure
declaration.  The procedure name <TT>id</TT> must be repeated after the
<TT>END</TT> that terminates the body.
<P>

The second form declares <TT>id</TT> to be a procedure constant whose 
signature is <TT>sig</TT>.  The procedure body is specified in a module 
exporting the interface, by a declaration of the first form.
