<P>

An interface has the form:
<PRE>
    INTERFACE id;
      Imports;
      Decls
    END id.
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>id</TT> is an identifier that names the interface, <TT>
Imports</TT> is a sequence of import statements, and <TT>Decls</TT> is 
a sequence of declarations that contains no procedure bodies or 
non-constant variable initializations.  The names declared in <TT>
Decls</TT> and the visible imported names must be distinct. It is a static 
error for two or more interfaces to form an import cycle.
