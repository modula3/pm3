will ship all the build directories (for different architectural
variants) that exist in the package.  It will refuse to ship anything if 
it finds a variant that was built with "overrides", unless the "-k" option 
is given, in which case it will ship all the variants except those that
were built with overrides.
<P>

The syntax for invoking <B>m3ship</B> is
<PRE>
     m3ship [options]

<P>

The following options are interpreted by <B>m3ship</B>.
<UL>

<LI> <B>-k</B>
Don't generate an error message if any of the .M3SHIP files are
missing.  Keep on going.
<P>

<LI> <B>-b</B> <I>"dir"</I>
Use the  <I>dir</I> configuration and ship from the directory named <I>dir</I>.
The default directory is configured into m3ship when
it is installed.
<P>

<LI> <B>-d</B> <I>"dir"</I>
Change the current directory to <I>dir</I>
before doing anything.
<P>

<LI> <B>-S</B>
Ship derived objects regardless of the current directory's name.
Normally, if the current working directory is <B>src</B>, <B>m3ship</B>
will refuse to build derived objects in it.
<P>

<LI> <B>-T</B> <I>"dir"</I>
Read templates from <I>dir</I>
instead of the default location.
