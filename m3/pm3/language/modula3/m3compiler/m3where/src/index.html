<H1>m3where</H1>

<P>
<EM>m3where</EM>
is a program that locates Modula-3 source files, relative to a
particular program or library package. By default it locates the given
units relative to the default build directory of the package that is
rooted at the current working directory. The <B>-d</B> option can be used
to specify the pathname of a particular package to be used to locate
the units. Sources that are <EM>hidden</EM> (not exported) by the
packages are not located unless option <B>-h</B> is set.

<P>
The syntax for invoking <B>m3where</B> is
<PRE>
     m3where [options] [units ...]
</PRE>

<P>
If no units are given, <B>m3where</B> enumerates all of the sources
associated with the package and those that it imports. Sources that are 
<EM>hidden</EM> (not exported) are not shown unless option <B>-h</B> is set.

<P>
The units are specified as filenames of the form "<TT>Foo.</TT><EM>xx</EM>",
where "<EM>xx</EM>" is one of the standard
Modula-3 file extensions (.i3, .m3, .ig, .mg...).
Wildcards are not supported.

<P>
Note that, in order for <B>m3where</B> to work,
<A HREF="../../m3build/src/index.html">m3build</A> must have
been run at least once for the given package/build directory pair.

<P>
If the given units can be located, the full pathnames are output
to the standard output, otherwise an error message is output.

<P>
The following options are interpreted by <B>m3where</B>.

<UL>

<LI> <B>-h</B>
Show all sources, including the hidden ones.

<LI> <B>-b</B> <I>"dir"</I>
Search the build directory named <I>dir</I>.
The default directory is configured into <B>m3where</B> when
it is installed.

<LI> <B>-d</B> <I>"dir"</I>
Locate units from the package that is rooted at <I>dir</I>.
<I>dir</I> must be an absolute pathname.

<LI> <B>-T</B> <I>"dir"</I>
Read templates from <I>dir</I>
instead of the default location.
</UL>

<P>
For example,
<PRE>
    m3where Pathname.i3
</PRE>
<P>would try to find the file <EM>Pathname.i3</EM> from the
information in the build directory of the package rooted at the
current working directory.

<P>And,
<PRE>
    m3where -b NT386GNU -d /proj/m3/pkg/libm3 PathnameWin32.m3
</PRE>
<P>would try to find the file <EM>PathnameWin32.m3</EM>
using the information in the <EM>NT386GNU</EM> build directory of
the <EM>libm3</EM> package.
