<H1>The Reachability Requirement</H1>
<P>

When building a program, the linker determines which units (interfaces
and modules) to include by traversing a directed graph. The nodes of
the graph correspond to program units, and certain nodes of the graph
are designated as <I>roots</I>. A unit <I>u</I> is included in the
build if and only if <I>u</I> is reachable from some root, that is, if
there exists a (possibly empty) path in the graph from some root
<I>r</I> to <I>u</I>. We must now describe how the linker determines
the set of roots and the set of edges in this graph.<P>

Each program's <I>m3makefile</I> specifies a set of sources via quake
calls like <B>interface(X)</B>, <B>implementation(X)</B>, and
<B>module(X)</B>. Each of these calls adds the name of the source file
(or unit) to the set of program sources.
These program sources constitute the set of roots used
to start the traversal. Notice that source files included via
<B>include_dir(D)</B> or <B>include_pkg(P)</B> will get added to this
list, but not those imported via <B>import(P)</B>.<P>

The edges of the graph are determined by the IMPORT and EXPORTS
relations among the units. An edge exists in the graph from the unit
<I>A</I> to the unit <I>B</I> if and only if:<P>

<UL>
<LI> <I>A</I> IMPORTs <I>B</I>,
<LI> <I>A</I> EXPORTS <I>B</I>, or
<LI> <I>B</I> EXPORTS <I>A</I>.
</UL>

<P>That is, if A IMPORTs B, then there is a directed edge from A to B in
the graph, but if A EXPORTS B, then there is a bi-directional edge
between A and B.<P>
