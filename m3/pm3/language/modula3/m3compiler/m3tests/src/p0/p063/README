The following four files gave me a version stamp error when 
compiled with the m3-1.5 compiler on a SPARC.  (I got the same 
error with the 1.5-beta compiler as well)

...

When I compile them all together, I get the following:

%m3 -g A.i3 B.i3 A.m3 Main.m3
ld: Undefined symbol 
   _VS_B__BT2__2a5dfe062d76bf04 
   _VS_B__BT3__a5c1dbc638b36289
