elf22: cat foo.m3

MODULE foo EXPORTS Main;

IMPORT Fmt, Stdio, Wr;

TYPE
  Short = [-16_8000 .. 16_7FFF];

VAR
  s: Short;

BEGIN
  Wr.PutText(Stdio.stderr, "BYTESIZE(s) = " & Fmt.Int(BYTESIZE(s)) & "\n");
  Wr.PutText(Stdio.stderr, "BYTESIZE(Short) = " & Fmt.Int(BYTESIZE(Short)) & "\n");
END foo.

elf22: a.out

BYTESIZE(s) = 4
BYTESIZE(Short) = 2
