Subject: Fwd: M3 ARRAY problem


Bug report from Cambridge (plus small machine woes).  I have verified
that this is still a bug in the 19oct90 version.

Mick -

Our main problems arise from running SRC M3 on DECstation 3100s with only 12 Mb
of memory and the local disc used just for swap and tmp, compounded by setting
students' NFS disc quotas at 2Mb.  ld often runs out of room and leaves files in
an unsatisfactory state.

Modula-3 curiosity -

I have the following program:

MODULE Main;

TYPE
    Letter = ['A' .. 'Z'];
    Code = ARRAY Letter OF CHAR;

VAR
    code: Code;

BEGIN
    code ['A'] := 'B';

END Main.

The compiler says:

$ m3 -c Main.m3
"Main.m3", line 11: illegal operands for '-'
1 error encountered
$

What is the problem?
