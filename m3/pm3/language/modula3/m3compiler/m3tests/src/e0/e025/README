MODULE C EXPORTS Main;

IMPORT Ctypes;

PROCEDURE P(chars: ARRAY OF CHAR) RAISES {}=
  BEGIN
    
  END P;

VAR a: ARRAY [0..9] OF Ctypes.Char;

BEGIN
  P(a);
END C.


No error message here, despite Ctypes.Char being defined as a subrange
[-128..127].

Question: What value is there in defining it as a subrange rather than
CHAR?
