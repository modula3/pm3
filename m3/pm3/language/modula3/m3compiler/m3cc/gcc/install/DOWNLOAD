   GCC is distributed via CVS and FTP tarballs compressed with gzip or
   bzip2. It is possible to download a full distribution or specific
   components.

   Please refer to our [1]releases web page for information on how to
   obtain GCC.

   The full distribution includes the C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java,
   and Chill compilers. The full distribution also includes runtime
   libraries for C++, Objective-C and Fortran. In the future the GNU
   compiler testsuites will be included in the full distribution.

   If you choose to download specific components, you must download the
   core gcc distribution plus any language specific distributions you
   wish to use. The core distribution includes the C language front-end
   as well as the shared components. Each language has a tarball which
   includes the language front-end as well as the language runtime (when
   appropriate).

   Unpack the core distribution as well as any language specific
   distributions in the same directory.

   If you also intend to build binutils (either to upgrade an existing
   installation or for use in place of the corresponding tools of your
   OS), unpack the binutils distribution either in the same directory or
   a separate one. In the latter case, add symbolic links to any
   components of the binutils you intend to build alongside the compiler
   (bfd, binutils, gas, gprof, ld, opcodes,...) to the directory
   containing the GCC sources.
