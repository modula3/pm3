   We are often asked about pre-compiled versions of GCC. While we cannot
   provide these for all platforms, below you'll find links to binaries
   for various platforms where creating them by yourself is not easy due
   to various reasons.

   Please note that we did not create these binaries, nor do we support
   them. If you have any problems installing them, please contact their
   makers.
     * [1]AIX
     * DOS: [2]DJGPP
     * [3]HP-UX Porting Center
     * [4]SCO OpenServer/Unixware
     * Solaris (SPARC, Intel): [5]Sunfreeware
     * SGI: [6]SGI Freeware
     * Windows 95, 98, and NT: [7]Cygwin for Windows 95, 98, and NT |
       [8]GNU Win32 related projects by Mumit Khan
     * [9]The Written Word offers binaries for Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6,
       2.7/SPARC, 2.7/Intel, IRIX 6.2, 6.5, Digital UNIX 4.0D, HP-UX
       10.20, and HP-UX 11.00.
     * Hitachi H8/300[HS]: [10]GNU Development Tools for the Hitachi
       H8/300[HS] Series

   In addition to those specific offerings, you can get a binary
   distribution CD-ROM from the [11]Free Software Foundation. It contains
   binaries for a number of platforms, and includes not only GCC, but
   other stuff as well. The current CD does not contain the latest
   version of GCC, but it should allow bootstrapping the compiler. An
   updated version of that disk is in the works.
