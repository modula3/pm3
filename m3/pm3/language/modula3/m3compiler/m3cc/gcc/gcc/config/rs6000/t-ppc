# PowerPC support without gas

# Build libgcc.a with different options.  If no gas support, don't build
# explicit little endian or big endian libraries, since it depends on the
# -mbig/-mlittle switches passed to gas.  The -mrelocatable support also needs
# -mrelocatable passed to gas, so don't use it either.
