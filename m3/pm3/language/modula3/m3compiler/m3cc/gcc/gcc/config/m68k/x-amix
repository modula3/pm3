# Link the executables with -ansi to get ANSI floating point ranges.
# Otherwise the values returned on overflow or underflow will be wrong.
# NOTE: some early releases of Amiga Unix contained a bug in ptod.o

# when linked with -ansi.  Sometimes -static will fix this since at least
# one version had a fixed copy in the static libc.a.
