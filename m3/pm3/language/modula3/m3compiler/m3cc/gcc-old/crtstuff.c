/* This file is a bit like libgcc1.c/libgcc2.c in that it is compiled
   multiple times and yields multiple .o files.

   This file is useful on target machines where the object file format
   supports multiple "user-defined" sections (e.g. COFF, ELF, ROSE).  On
   such systems, this file allows us to avoid running collect (or any
   other such slow and painful kludge).  Additionally, if the target
   system supports a .init section, this file allows us to support the
   linking of C++ code with a non-C++ main program.

   Note that if INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP is defined in the tm.h file, then
   this file *will* make use of the .init section.  If that symbol is
   not defined however, then the .init section will not be used.

   Currently, only ELF and COFF are supported.  It is likely however that
   ROSE could also be supported, if someone was willing to do the work to
   make whatever (small?) adaptations are needed.  (Some work may be
   needed on the ROSE assembler and linker also.)

   This file must be compiled with gcc.  */

/* It is incorrect to include config.h here, because this file is being
   compiled for the target, and hence definitions concerning only the host
   do not apply.  */

#include "tm.h"

/* Provide default definitions for the pseudo-ops used to switch to the
   .ctors and .dtors sections.
 
   Note that we want to give these sections the SHF_WRITE attribute
   because these sections will actually contain data (i.e. tables of
   addresses of functions in the current root executable or shared library
   file) and, in the case of a shared library, the relocatable addresses
   will have to be properly resolved/relocated (and then written into) by
   the dynamic linker when it actually attaches the given shared library
   to the executing process.  (Note that on SVR4, you may wish to use the
   `-z text' option to the ELF linker, when building a shared library, as
   an additional check that you are doing everything right.  But if you do
   use the `-z text' option when building a shared library, you will get
   errors unless the .ctors and .dtors sections are marked as writable
   via the SHF_WRITE attribute.)  */
