# This used to redefine CFLAGS and LIBGCC2_CFLAGS to eliminate the unsupported
# -g flag from both macros.  This gives an undebuggable stage1 compiler which
# is bad, and it also does the wrong thing if we are cross compiling to a
# target which does support debugging.  There is currently no way to avoid
# the -g option that doesn't break something else.

# Apollo does not have B option.
