# We force the use of the O32 ABI for two reasons.
# 1) For consistency, because some versions of Irix 6 default to the O32 ABI
#    and some versions default to the N64 ABI.
# 2) To avoid SGI compiler bugs.  The v6.x and v7.0 compilers from SGI have
#    bugs that cause gcc to be miscompiled when the N32 or N64 ABIs are used.
#    The O32 ABI is known to be OK.
