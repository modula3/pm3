## Supposedly not needed now that xm-sysv4.h includes alloc.h for Metaware.
### NCR3000 ships with a MetaWare compiler installed as CC, which chokes and
### dies all over the place on GCC source.  However, the AT&T compiler,
### crusty as it is, can be used to bootstrap GCC.  It can be found in
### /usr/ccs/ATT/cc.  It is also used to compile the things that should
### not be compiled with GCC.

# The rest is just x-i386v4.

# Some versions of SVR4 have an alloca in /usr/ucblib/libucb.a, and if we are
# careful to link that in after libc we can use it, but since newer versions of
# SVR4 are dropping libucb, it is better to just use the portable C version for
# bootstrapping.  Do this by defining ALLOCA.

# We used to build all stages *without* shared libraries because that may make
# debugging the compiler easier (until there is a GDB which supports
# both Dwarf *and* svr4 shared libraries).

# But james@bigtex.cactus.org says that redefining GCC_CFLAGS causes trouble,
# and that it is easy enough to debug using shared libraries.
