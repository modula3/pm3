# Define CC and OLDCC as the same, so that the tests:
#	if [ x"$(OLDCC)" = x"$(CC)" ] ...
#
# will succeed (if OLDCC != CC, it is assumed that GCC is
# being used in secondary stage builds).  We need to pass
# the -Wf,-XNg1500 option so the compiler can compile the
# G++ file cp-parse.c.  Otherwise it complains about
# too many case statements.  -Olimit is so the user
# can use -O2.  Down with fixed size tables!

# In at least one version of Irix, v3.3.2, the compiler does not accept
# the -cckr option, so, lets try without it for all versions of Irix 3.x.
# The -cckr is to turn off strict ANSI checking.

# The bison output files are machine-indep,
