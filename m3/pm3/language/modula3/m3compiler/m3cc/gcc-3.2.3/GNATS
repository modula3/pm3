                      Submitting Bug Reports using GNATS

gnatsweb and gccbug

   GNATS, the GNU bug tracking system, is used to track GCC bug reports.
   Before submitting a bug report, please read the [1]general
   instructions.

   The preferred way to submit a bug report is by means of the
   [2]gnatsweb interface. Make sure you include an e-mail address, so we
   can inform you when the status of your report changes.

   Another way is to use the gccbug program that is automatically
   installed with current versions of GCC, which submits the bug report
   by e-mail.

   Both techniques use the same GNATS bug database.

Filling out a report

   The bug report form provides a number of fields; you'll need to
   fill-out most of those (as indicated below) to provide a complete
   report. The fields have the following purpose:

   Originator
          Your name.

   Organization
          Your organization. You can leave this field blank.

   Confidential
          This field is unused and set to 'no'. All bug reports,
          including sample code, are publicly accessible.

   Synopsis
          A one-line description of the problem; something like "GCC 2.95
          does not foo", "objc crashes when doing bar".

   Severity
          Can be one of

        critical
                GCC is completely not operational; no work-around known.

        serious
                GCC is not working properly; a work-around is possible.

        non-critical
                Report indicates minor problem.

   Priority
          Can be one of

        high
                A solution is necessary as soon as possible. This is
                reserved to GCC maintainers.

        medium
                The problem should be solved in the next release.

        low
                The problem should be solved in a future release.

   Category
          This indicates the GCC subproject which is affected by the
          problem. Currently, it can be one of

        ada
                A problem with the Ada compiler front end, libraries or
                tools.

        bootstrap
                GCC fails to bootstrap. This should be filed only if a
                bootstrap failure prevails for an extended period of time
                (at least one week) on any platform (and possibly
                not-so-common conditions like a read-only srcdir), or
                non-mainstream platforms.

        c++
                A problem with the C++ compiler front end.

        c
                A problem with the C compiler front end.

        debug
                A problem with generating debugging information.

        driver
                A problem with a compiler driver, namely gcc, g++, g77,
                gcj or gnat.

        fortran
                A problem with the Fortran compiler front end.

        inline-asm
                A problem caused by use of inline assembly.

        java
                A problem with the Java compiler front end.

        libf2c
                A problem in the Fortran runtime library.

        libgcj
                A problem in the Java runtime library.

        libobjc
                A problem in the Objective C runtime library.

        libstdc++
                A problem in the Standard C++ runtime library.

        middle-end
                A problem in the internal compiler passes.

        objc
                A problem with the Objective C compiler.

        optimization
                A problem only occurring under optimization.

        preprocessor
                A problem with the C preprocessor.

        target
                The problem depends on the specific target architecture.

        web
                There is an error or omission on the Web pages.

        other
                The problem is in none of these categories.

   Class
          A classification of the problem; one of

        doc-bug
                The documentation is incorrect.

        accepts-illegal
                GCC fails to reject erroneous code.

        rejects-legal
                GCC gives an error message for correct code.

        wrong-code
                The machine code generated by GCC is incorrect.

        ice-on-legal-code
                GCC gives an Internal Compiler Error (ICE) for correct
                code.

        ice-on-illegal-code
                GCC gives an ICE instead of reporting an error.

        pessimizes-code
                GCC misses an important optimization opportunity.

        sw-bug
                Software bug of some other class than above.

        change-request
                A feature in GCC is missing.

        support
                I need help with GCC.

   Release
          GCC version, as obtained from 'gcc -v' (one line).

   Environment
          Information about your operating system version, hardware
          architecture, and environment settings that affect GCC.

   Description
          Precise description of the problem. You should put the error
          messages printed by GCC here; source code should go into the
          next section.

   How-To-Repeat
          Please put the complete source code to reproduce the problem
          here. The gccbug script currently does not support file
          attachments. Instead, if you have multiple files, include them
          uuencoded (compressing them before if they are large). If you
          use gnatsweb, you can use the file attachments button instead.

   Fix
          How to correct or work around the problem, if known (multiple
          lines).
