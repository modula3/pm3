gcc-ss-@DATE@ is now available on 
  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/snapshots/@LONG_DATE@
and on various mirrors, see http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html for details.

This snapshot has been generated from the current development mainline
which is going to become GCC 3.1.

You'll find:

  gcc-@DATE@.tar.gz                  The full gcc snapshot, including all
                                       languages runtime libraries.

  gcc-core-@DATE@.tar.gz             Just the C front end and core compiler.

  gcc-tests-@DATE@.tar.gz            The GCC testsuite.

  gcc-ada-@DATE@.tar.gz              The Ada language and runtime.

  gcc-g++-@DATE@.tar.gz              The g++ language and runtime.

  gcc-g++-tests-@DATE@.tar.gz	       The testsuite for G++.

  gcc-g77-@DATE@.tar.gz              The g77 language and runtime.
   
  gcc-g77-testsuite-@DATE@.tar.gz    The testsuite for G77.

  gcc-objc-@DATE@.tar.gz             The Objective-C front end and runtime.

  gcc-java-@DATE@.tar.gz             The Java front end.

Diffs from @LAST_DATE@ are available.

Note at times you may find newer directories on the server with limited
permissions.  These represent snapshots that have not yet been verified
as correct, or are known to be incorrect.

When a particular snapshot is ready for public consumption the directory
permissions are relaxed, the LATEST-IS- file is updated and a message is
sent to the gcc list.

Using a snapshot before it's officially made available is an unwise thing
to do since it may become impossible to update to an official snapshot.

The "gcc_latest_snapshot" tag has been moved.  You can use
cvs update -rgcc_latest_snapshot to update your CVS tree to the latest
official snapshot.
