The latest version of this document is always available at
@uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/install/,,http://gcc.gnu.org/install/}.

This document describes the generic installation procedure for GCC as well
as detailing some target specific installation instructions.

GCC includes several components that previously were separate distributions
with their own installation instructions.  This document supersedes all
package specific installation instructions.

@emph{Before} starting the build/install procedure please check the
@ifnothtml
@ref{Specific, host/target specific installation notes}.
@end ifnothtml
@ifhtml
@uref{specific.html,,host/target specific installation notes}.
@end ifhtml
We recommend you browse the entire generic installation instructions before
you proceed.

Lists of successful builds for released versions of GCC are
available at @uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/buildstat.html}. 
These lists are updated as new information becomes available.

The installation procedure itself is broken into five steps.

Please note that GCC does not support @samp{make uninstall} and probably
won't do so in the near future as this would open a can of worms.  Instead,
we suggest that you install GCC into a directory of its own and simply
remove that directory when you do not need that specific version of GCC
any longer, and, if shared libraries are installed there as well, no
more binaries exist that use them.

There are also some @uref{old.html,,old installation instructions},

@cindex Downloading the Source

GCC is distributed via @uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/cvs.html,,CVS} and FTP
tarballs compressed with @command{gzip} or
@command{bzip2}.  It is possible to download a full distribution or specific
components.

Please refer to our @uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html,,releases web page}
for information on how to obtain GCC@.

The full distribution includes the C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java,
and Ada (in case of GCC 3.1 and later) compilers.  The full distribution
also includes runtime libraries for C++, Objective-C, Fortran, and Java.
In GCC 3.0 and later versions, GNU compiler testsuites are also included
in the full distribution.

If you choose to download specific components, you must download the core
GCC distribution plus any language specific distributions you wish to
use.  The core distribution includes the C language front end as well as the
shared components.  Each language has a tarball which includes the language
front end as well as the language runtime (when appropriate).

Unpack the core distribution as well as any language specific
distributions in the same directory.

If you also intend to build binutils (either to upgrade an existing
installation or for use in place of the corresponding tools of your
OS), unpack the binutils distribution either in the same directory or
a separate one.  In the latter case, add symbolic links to any
components of the binutils you intend to build alongside the compiler
(@file{bfd}, @file{binutils}, @file{gas}, @file{gprof}, @file{ld},
@file{opcodes}, @dots{}) to the directory containing the GCC sources.

@cindex Configuration
@cindex Installing GCC: Configuration

Like most GNU software, GCC must be configured before it can be built.
This document describes the recommended configuration procedure
for both native and cross targets.

We use @var{srcdir} to refer to the toplevel source directory for
GCC; we use @var{objdir} to refer to the toplevel build/object directory.

If you obtained the sources via CVS, @var{srcdir} must refer to the top
@file{gcc} directory, the one where the @file{MAINTAINERS} can be found,
and not its @file{gcc} subdirectory, otherwise the build will fail.

First, we @strong{highly} recommend that GCC be built into a
separate directory than the sources which does @strong{not} reside
within the source tree.  This is how we generally build GCC; building
where @var{srcdir} == @var{objdir} should still work, but doesn't
get extensive testing; building where @var{objdir} is a subdirectory
of @var{srcdir} is unsupported.

If you have previously built GCC in the same directory for a
different target machine, do @samp{make distclean} to delete all files
that might be invalid.  One of the files this deletes is
@file{Makefile}; if @samp{make distclean} complains that @file{Makefile}
does not exist, it probably means that the directory is already suitably
clean.  However, with the recommended method of building in a separate
@var{objdir}, you should simply use a different @var{objdir} for each
target.

Second, when configuring a native system, either @command{cc} or
@command{gcc} must be in your path or you must set @env{CC} in
your environment before running configure.  Otherwise the configuration
scripts may fail.

Note that the bootstrap compiler and the resulting GCC must be link
compatible, else the bootstrap will fail with linker errors about
incompatible object file formats.  Several multilibed targets are
affected by this requirement, see
@ifnothtml
@ref{Specific, host/target specific installation notes}.
@end ifnothtml
@ifhtml
@uref{specific.html,,host/target specific installation notes}.
@end ifhtml

To configure GCC:

@example
   % mkdir @var{objdir}
   % cd @var{objdir}
   % @var{srcdir}/configure [@var{options}] [@var{target}]
@end example


@heading Target specification
@itemize @bullet
@item
GCC has code to correctly determine the correct value for @var{target}
for nearly all native systems.  Therefore, we highly recommend you not
provide a configure target when configuring a native compiler.

@item
@var{target} must be specified as @option{--target=@var{target}}
when configuring a cross compiler; examples of valid targets would be
i960-rtems, m68k-coff, sh-elf, etc.

@item
Specifying just @var{target} instead of @option{--target=@var{target}}
implies that the host defaults to @var{target}.
@end itemize


@heading Options specification

Use @var{options} to override several configure time options for
GCC@.  A list of supported @var{options} follows; @command{configure
--help} may list other options, but those not listed below may not
work and should not normally be used.

@table @code
@item --prefix=@var{dirname}
Specify the toplevel installation
directory.  This is the recommended way to install the tools into a directory
other than the default.  The toplevel installation directory defaults to
@file{/usr/local}.

We @strong{highly} recommend against @var{dirname} being the same or a
subdirectory of @var{objdir} or vice versa.

These additional options control where certain parts of the distribution
are installed.  Normally you should not need to use these options.
@table @code
@item --exec-prefix=@var{dirname}
Specify the toplevel installation directory for architecture-dependent
files.  The default is @file{@var{prefix}}.

@item --bindir=@var{dirname}
Specify the installation directory for the executables called by users
(such as @command{gcc} and @command{g++}).  The default is
@file{@var{exec-prefix}/bin}.

@item --libdir=@var{dirname}
Specify the installation directory for object code libraries and
internal parts of GCC@.  The default is @file{@var{exec-prefix}/lib}.

@item --with-slibdir=@var{dirname}
Specify the installation directory for the shared libgcc library.  The
default is @file{@var{libdir}}.

@item --infodir=@var{dirname}
Specify the installation directory for documentation in info format.
The default is @file{@var{prefix}/info}.

@item --mandir=@var{dirname}
Specify the installation directory for manual pages.  The default is
@file{@var{prefix}/man}.  (Note that the manual pages are only extracts from
the full GCC manuals, which are provided in Texinfo format.  The
@command{g77} manpage is unmaintained and may be out of date; the others
are derived by an automatic conversion process from parts of the full
manual.)

@item --with-gxx-include-dir=@var{dirname}
Specify
the installation directory for G++ header files.  The default is
@file{@var{prefix}/include/g++-v3}.

@end table

@item --program-prefix=@var{prefix}
GCC supports some transformations of the names of its programs when
installing them. This option prepends @var{prefix} to the names of
programs to install in @var{bindir} (see above). For example, specifying
@option{--program-prefix=foo-} would result in @samp{gcc}
being installed as @file{/usr/local/bin/foo-gcc}.

@item --program-suffix=@var{suffix}
Appends @var{suffix} to the names of programs to install in @var{bindir}
(see above). For example, specifying @option{--program-suffix=-3.1}
would result in @samp{gcc} being installed as
@file{/usr/local/bin/gcc-3.1}.

@item --program-transform-name=@var{pattern}
Applies the @samp{sed} script @var{pattern} to be applied to the names
of programs to install in @var{bindir} (see above). @var{pattern} has to
consist of one or more basic @samp{sed} editing commands, separated by
semicolons. For example, if you want the @samp{gcc} program name to be
transformed to the installed program @file{/usr/local/bin/myowngcc} and
the @samp{g++} program name to be transformed to
@file{/usr/local/bin/gspecial++} without changing other program names,
you could use the pattern
@option{--program-transform-name='s/^gcc$/myowngcc/; s/^g++$/gspecial++/'}
to achieve this effect.

All three options can be combined and used together, resulting in more
complex conversion patterns. As a basic rule, @var{prefix} (and
@var{suffix}) are prepended (appended) before further transformations
can happen with a special transformation script @var{pattern}.

As currently implemented, these options only take effect for native
builds; cross compiler binaries' names are not transformed even when a
transformation is explicitly asked for by one of these options.

For native builds, some of the installed programs are also installed
with the target alias in front of their name, as in
@samp{i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc}. All of the above transformations happen
before the target alias is prepended to the name - so, specifying
@option{--program-prefix=foo-} and @option{program-suffix=-3.1}, the
resulting binary would be installed as
@file{/usr/local/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu-foo-gcc-3.1}.

As a last shortcoming, none of the installed Ada programs are
transformed yet, which will be fixed in some time.

@item --with-local-prefix=@var{dirname}
Specify the
installation directory for local include files.  The default is
@file{/usr/local}.  Specify this option if you want the compiler to
search directory @file{@var{dirname}/include} for locally installed
header files @emph{instead} of @file{/usr/local/include}.

You should specify @option{--with-local-prefix} @strong{only} if your
site has a different convention (not @file{/usr/local}) for where to put
site-specific files.

The default value for @option{--with-local-prefix} is @file{/usr/local}
regardless of the value of @option{--prefix}.  Specifying
@option{--prefix} has no effect on which directory GCC searches for
local header files.  This may seem counterintuitive, but actually it is
logical.

The purpose of @option{--prefix} is to specify where to @emph{install
GCC}.  The local header files in @file{/usr/local/include}---if you put
any in that directory---are not part of GCC@.  They are part of other
programs---perhaps many others.  (GCC installs its own header files in
another directory which is based on the @option{--prefix} value.)

Both the local-prefix include directory and the GCC-prefix include
directory are part of GCC's "system include" directories.  Although these
two directories are not fixed, they need to be searched in the proper
order for the correct processing of the include_next directive.  The
local-prefix include directory is searched before the GCC-prefix
include directory.  Another characteristic of system include directories
is that pedantic warnings are turned off for headers in these directories.

Some autoconf macros add @option{-I @var{directory}} options to the
compiler command line, to ensure that directories containing installed
packages' headers are searched.  When @var{directory} is one of GCC's
system include directories, GCC will ignore the option so that system
directories continue to be processed in the correct order.  This
may result in a search order different from what was specified but the
directory will still be searched.

GCC automatically searches for ordinary libraries using
@env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX}.  Thus, when the same installation prefix is
used for both GCC and packages, GCC will automatically search for
both headers and libraries.  This provides a configuration that is
easy to use.  GCC behaves in a manner similar to that when it is
installed as a system compiler in @file{/usr}.

Sites that need to install multiple versions of GCC may not want to
use the above simple configuration.  It is possible to use the
@option{--program-prefix}, @option{--program-suffix} and
@option{--program-transform-name} options to install multiple versions
into a single directory, but it may be simpler to use different prefixes
and the @option{--with-local-prefix} option to specify the location of the
site-specific files for each version.  It will then be necessary for
users to specify explicitly the location of local site libraries
(e.g., with @env{LIBRARY_PATH}).

The same value can be used for both @option{--with-local-prefix} and
@option{--prefix} provided it is not @file{/usr}.  This can be used
to avoid the default search of @file{/usr/local/include}.

@strong{Do not} specify @file{/usr} as the @option{--with-local-prefix}!
The directory you use for @option{--with-local-prefix} @strong{must not}
contain any of the system's standard header files.  If it did contain
them, certain programs would be miscompiled (including GNU Emacs, on
certain targets), because this would override and nullify the header
file corrections made by the @command{fixincludes} script.

Indications are that people who use this option use it based on mistaken
ideas of what it is for.  People use it as if it specified where to
install part of GCC@.  Perhaps they make this assumption because
installing GCC creates the directory.

@item --enable-shared[=@var{package}[,@dots{}]]
Build shared versions of libraries, if shared libraries are supported on
the target platform.  Unlike GCC 2.95.x and earlier, shared libraries
are enabled by default on all platforms that support shared libraries,
except for @samp{libobjc} which is built as a static library only by
default.

If a list of packages is given as an argument, build shared libraries
only for the listed packages.  For other packages, only static libraries
will be built.  Package names currently recognized in the GCC tree are
@samp{libgcc} (also known as @samp{gcc}), @samp{libstdc++} (not
@samp{libstdc++-v3}), @samp{libffi}, @samp{zlib}, @samp{boehm-gc} and
@samp{libjava}.  Note that @samp{libobjc} does not recognize itself by
any name, so, if you list package names in @option{--enable-shared},
you will only get static Objective-C libraries.  @samp{libf2c} and
@samp{libiberty} do not support shared libraries at all.

Use @option{--disable-shared} to build only static libraries.  Note that
@option{--disable-shared} does not accept a list of package names as
argument, only @option{--enable-shared} does.

@item @anchor{with-gnu-as}--with-gnu-as
Specify that the compiler should assume that the
assembler it finds is the GNU assembler.  However, this does not modify
the rules to find an assembler and will result in confusion if found
assembler is not actually the GNU assembler.  (Confusion will also
result if the compiler finds the GNU assembler but has not been
configured with @option{--with-gnu-as}.)  If you have more than one
assembler installed on your system, you may want to use this option in
connection with @option{--with-as=@var{pathname}}.

The following systems are the only ones where it makes a difference
whether you use the GNU assembler.  On any other system,
@option{--with-gnu-as} has no effect.

@itemize bullet
@item @samp{hppa1.0-@var{any}-@var{any}}
@item @samp{hppa1.1-@var{any}-@var{any}}
@item @samp{i386-@var{any}-sysv}
@item @samp{i386-@var{any}-isc}
@item @samp{i860-@var{any}-bsd}
@item @samp{m68k-bull-sysv}
@item @samp{m68k-hp-hpux}
@item @samp{m68k-sony-bsd}
@item @samp{m68k-altos-sysv}
@item @samp{m68000-hp-hpux}
@item @samp{m68000-att-sysv}
@item @samp{@var{any}-lynx-lynxos}
@item @samp{mips-@var{any}}
@end itemize

On the systems listed above (except for the HP-PA, for ISC on the
386, and for @samp{mips-sgi-irix5.*}), if you use the GNU assembler,
you should also use the GNU linker (and specify @option{--with-gnu-ld}).

@item --with-as=@var{pathname}
Specify that the
compiler should use the assembler pointed to by @var{pathname}, rather
than the one found by the standard rules to find an assembler, which
are:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Check the
@file{@var{exec_prefix}/lib/gcc-lib/@var{target}/@var{version}}
directory, where @var{exec_prefix} defaults to @var{prefix} which
defaults to @file{/usr/local} unless overridden by the
@option{--prefix=@var{pathname}} switch described above. @var{target} is the
target system triple, such as @samp{sparc-sun-solaris2.7}, and
@var{version} denotes the GCC version, such as 3.0.
@item
Check operating system specific directories (e.g.@: @file{/usr/ccs/bin} on
Sun Solaris 2).
@end itemize
Note that these rules do not check for the value of @env{PATH}.  You may
want to use @option{--with-as} if no assembler is installed in the
directories listed above, or if you have multiple assemblers installed
and want to choose one that is not found by the above rules.

@item @anchor{with-gnu-ld}--with-gnu-ld
Same as @uref{#with-gnu-as,,@option{--with-gnu-as}}
but for linker.


@item --with-ld=@var{pathname}
Same as
@option{--with-as}, but for the linker.

@item --with-stabs
Specify that stabs debugging
information should be used instead of whatever format the host normally
uses.  Normally GCC uses the same debug format as the host system.

On MIPS based systems and on Alphas, you must specify whether you want
GCC to create the normal ECOFF debugging format, or to use BSD-style
stabs passed through the ECOFF symbol table.  The normal ECOFF debug
format cannot fully handle languages other than C@.  BSD stabs format can
handle other languages, but it only works with the GNU debugger GDB@.

Normally, GCC uses the ECOFF debugging format by default; if you
prefer BSD stabs, specify @option{--with-stabs} when you configure GCC@.

No matter which default you choose when you configure GCC, the user
can use the @option{-gcoff} and @option{-gstabs+} options to specify explicitly
the debug format for a particular compilation.

@option{--with-stabs} is meaningful on the ISC system on the 386, also, if
@option{--with-gas} is used.  It selects use of stabs debugging
information embedded in COFF output.  This kind of debugging information
supports C++ well; ordinary COFF debugging information does not.

@option{--with-stabs} is also meaningful on 386 systems running SVR4.  It
selects use of stabs debugging information embedded in ELF output.  The
C++ compiler currently (2.6.0) does not support the DWARF debugging
information normally used on 386 SVR4 platforms; stabs provide a
workable alternative.  This requires gas and gdb, as the normal SVR4
tools can not generate or interpret stabs.

@item --disable-multilib
Specify that multiple target
libraries to support different target variants, calling
conventions, etc should not be built.  The default is to build a
predefined set of them.

Some targets provide finer-grained control over which multilibs are built
(e.g., @option{--disable-softfloat}):
@table @code
@item arc-*-elf*
biendian.

@item arm-*-*
fpu, 26bit, underscore, interwork, biendian, nofmult.

@item m68*-*-*
softfloat, m68881, m68000, m68020.

@item mips*-*-*
single-float, biendian, softfloat.

@item powerpc*-*-*, rs6000*-*-*
aix64, pthread, softfloat, powercpu, powerpccpu, powerpcos, biendian,
sysv, aix.

@end table

@item --enable-threads
Specify that the target
supports threads.  This affects the Objective-C compiler and runtime
library, and exception handling for other languages like C++ and Java.
On some systems, this is the default.

In general, the best (and, in many cases, the only known) threading
model available will be configured for use.  Beware that on some
systems, gcc has not been taught what threading models are generally
available for the system.  In this case, @option{--enable-threads} is an
alias for @option{--enable-threads=single}.

@item --disable-threads
Specify that threading support should be disabled for the system.
This is an alias for @option{--enable-threads=single}.

@item --enable-threads=@var{lib}
Specify that
@var{lib} is the thread support library.  This affects the Objective-C
compiler and runtime library, and exception handling for other languages
like C++ and Java.  The possibilities for @var{lib} are:

@table @code
@item aix
AIX thread support.
@item dce
DCE thread support.
@item mach
Generic MACH thread support, known to work on NeXTSTEP@.  (Please note
that the file needed to support this configuration, @file{gthr-mach.h}, is
missing and thus this setting will cause a known bootstrap failure.)
@item no
This is an alias for @samp{single}.
@item posix
Generic POSIX thread support.
@item pthreads
Same as @samp{posix} on arm*-*-linux*, *-*-chorusos* and *-*-freebsd*
only.  A future release of gcc might remove this alias or extend it
to all platforms.
@item rtems
RTEMS thread support.
@item single
Disable thread support, should work for all platforms.
@item solaris
Sun Solaris 2 thread support.
@item vxworks
VxWorks thread support.
@item win32
Microsoft Win32 API thread support.
@end table

@item --with-cpu=@var{cpu}
Specify which cpu variant the
compiler should generate code for by default.  This is currently
only supported on the some ports, specifically arm, powerpc, and
SPARC@.  If configure does not recognize the model name (e.g.@: arm700,
603e, or ultrasparc) you provide, please check the configure script
for a complete list of supported models.

@item --enable-altivec
Specify that the target supports AltiVec vector enhancements.  This
option will adjust the ABI for AltiVec enhancements, as well as generate
AltiVec code when appropriate.  This option is only available for
PowerPC systems.

@item --enable-target-optspace
Specify that target
libraries should be optimized for code space instead of code speed.
This is the default for the m32r platform.

@item --disable-cpp
Specify that a user visible @command{cpp} program should not be installed.

@item --with-cpp-install-dir=@var{dirname}
Specify that the user visible @command{cpp} program should be installed
in @file{@var{prefix}/@var{dirname}/cpp}, in addition to @var{bindir}.

@item --enable-maintainer-mode
The build rules that
regenerate the GCC master message catalog @file{gcc.pot} are normally
disabled.  This is because it can only be rebuilt if the complete source
tree is present.  If you have changed the sources and want to rebuild the
catalog, configuring with @option{--enable-maintainer-mode} will enable
this.  Note that you need a recent version of the @code{gettext} tools
to do so.

@item --enable-version-specific-runtime-libs
Specify
that runtime libraries should be installed in the compiler specific
subdirectory (@file{@var{libsubdir}}) rather than the usual places.  In
addition, @samp{libstdc++}'s include files will be installed in
@file{@var{libsubdir}/include/g++} unless you overruled it by using
@option{--with-gxx-include-dir=@var{dirname}}.  Using this option is
particularly useful if you intend to use several versions of GCC in
parallel. This is currently supported by @samp{libf2c} and
@samp{libstdc++}, and is the default for @samp{libobjc} which cannot be
changed in this case.

@item --enable-languages=@var{lang1},@var{lang2},@dots{}
Specify that only a particular subset of compilers and
their runtime libraries should be built.  For a list of valid values for
@var{langN} you can issue the following command in the
@file{gcc} directory of your GCC source tree:@*
@example
grep language= */config-lang.in
@end example
Currently, you can use any of the following:
@code{ada}, @code{c}, @code{c++}, @code{f77}, @code{java}, @code{objc}.
Building the Ada compiler has special requirements, see below.@*
If you do not pass this flag, all languages available in the @file{gcc}
sub-tree will be configured.  Re-defining @code{LANGUAGES} when calling
@samp{make bootstrap} @strong{does not} work anymore, as those
language sub-directories might not have been configured!

@item --disable-libgcj
Specify that the run-time libraries
used by GCJ should not be built.  This is useful in case you intend
to use GCJ with some other run-time, or you're going to install it
separately, or it just happens not to build on your particular
machine.  In general, if the Java front end is enabled, the GCJ
libraries will be enabled too, unless they're known to not work on
the target platform.  If GCJ is enabled but @samp{libgcj} isn't built, you
may need to port it; in this case, before modifying the top-level
@file{configure.in} so that @samp{libgcj} is enabled by default on this platform,
you may use @option{--enable-libgcj} to override the default.

@item --with-dwarf2
Specify that the compiler should
use DWARF 2 debugging information as the default.

@item --enable-win32-registry
@itemx --enable-win32-registry=@var{key}
@itemx --disable-win32-registry
The @option{--enable-win32-registry} option enables Windows-hosted GCC
to look up installations paths in the registry using the following key:

@smallexample
@code{HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Free Software Foundation\@var{key}}
@end smallexample

@var{key} defaults to GCC version number, and can be overridden by the
@option{--enable-win32-registry=@var{key}} option. Vendors and distributors
who use custom installers are encouraged to provide a different key,
perhaps one comprised of vendor name and GCC version number, to
avoid conflict with existing installations.  This feature is enabled
by default, and can be disabled by @option{--disable-win32-registry}
option.  This option has no effect on the other hosts.

@item --nfp
Specify that the machine does not have a floating point unit.  This
option only applies to @samp{m68k-sun-sunos@var{n}} and
@samp{m68k-isi-bsd}.  On any other system, @option{--nfp} has no effect.

@item --enable-checking
@itemx --enable-checking=@var{list}
When you specify this option, the compiler is built to perform checking
of tree node types when referencing fields of that node, and some other
internal consistency checks.  This does not change the generated code,
but adds error checking within the compiler.  This will slow down the
compiler and may only work properly if you are building the compiler
with GCC@.  This is on by default when building from CVS or snapshots,
but off for releases.  More control over the checks may be had by
specifying @var{list}; the categories of checks available are
@samp{misc}, @samp{tree}, @samp{gc}, @samp{rtl} and @samp{gcac}.  The
default when @var{list} is not specified is @samp{misc,tree,gc}; the
checks @samp{rtl} and @samp{gcac} are very expensive.

@item --enable-nls
@itemx --disable-nls
The @option{--enable-nls} option enables Native Language Support (NLS),
which lets GCC output diagnostics in languages other than American
English.  Native Language Support is enabled by default if not doing a
canadian cross build.  The @option{--disable-nls} option disables NLS@.

@item --with-included-gettext
If NLS is enabled, the @option{--with-included-gettext} option causes the build
procedure to prefer its copy of GNU @command{gettext}.

@item --with-catgets
If NLS is enabled, and if the host lacks @code{gettext} but has the
inferior @code{catgets} interface, the GCC build procedure normally
ignores @code{catgets} and instead uses GCC's copy of the GNU
@code{gettext} library.  The @option{--with-catgets} option causes the
build procedure to use the host's @code{catgets} in this situation.

@item --with-libiconv-prefix=@var{dir}
Search for libiconv header files in @file{@var{dir}/include} and
libiconv library files in @file{@var{dir}/lib}.

@item --with-system-zlib
Use installed zlib rather than that included with GCC@.  This option
only applies if the Java front end is being built.

@item --enable-obsolete
Enable configuration for an obsoleted system.  If you attempt to
configure GCC for a system (build, host, or target) which has been
obsoleted, and you do not specify this flag, configure will halt with an
error message.

All support for systems which have been obsoleted in one release of GCC
is removed entirely in the next major release, unless someone steps
forward to maintain the port.
@end table

Some options which only apply to building cross compilers:
@table @code
@item --with-headers=@var{dir}
Specifies a directory
which has target include files.
@emph{This option is required} when building a cross
compiler, if @file{@var{prefix}/@var{target}/sys-include} doesn't pre-exist.
These include files will be copied into the @file{gcc} install directory.
@command{fixincludes} will be run on these files to make them compatible with
GCC.
@item --with-libs=``@var{dir1} @var{dir2} @dots{} @var{dirN}''
Specifies a list of directories which contain the target runtime
libraries.  These libraries will be copied into the @file{gcc} install
directory.
@item --with-newlib
Specifies that @samp{newlib} is
being used as the target C library.  This causes @code{__eprintf} to be
omitted from @file{libgcc.a} on the assumption that it will be provided by
@samp{newlib}.
@end table

Note that each @option{--enable} option has a corresponding
@option{--disable} option and that each @option{--with} option has a
corresponding @option{--without} option.

@cindex Installing GCC: Building

Now that GCC is configured, you are ready to build the compiler and
runtime libraries.

We @strong{highly} recommend that GCC be built using GNU make;
other versions may work, then again they might not.
GNU make is required for compiling GNAT (the Ada compiler) and the Java
runtime library.

(For example, many broken versions of make will fail if you use the
recommended setup where @var{objdir} is different from @var{srcdir}.
Other broken versions may recompile parts of the compiler when
installing the compiler.)

Some commands executed when making the compiler may fail (return a
nonzero status) and be ignored by @code{make}.  These failures, which
are often due to files that were not found, are expected, and can safely
be ignored.

It is normal to have compiler warnings when compiling certain files.
Unless you are a GCC developer, you can generally ignore these warnings
unless they cause compilation to fail.

On certain old systems, defining certain environment variables such as
@env{CC} can interfere with the functioning of @command{make}.

If you encounter seemingly strange errors when trying to build the
compiler in a directory other than the source directory, it could be
because you have previously configured the compiler in the source
directory.  Make sure you have done all the necessary preparations.

If you build GCC on a BSD system using a directory stored in an old System
V file system, problems may occur in running @command{fixincludes} if the
System V file system doesn't support symbolic links.  These problems
result in a failure to fix the declaration of @code{size_t} in
@file{sys/types.h}.  If you find that @code{size_t} is a signed type and
that type mismatches occur, this could be the cause.

The solution is not to use such a directory for building GCC@.

When building from CVS or snapshots, or if you modify parser sources,
you need the Bison parser generator installed.  Any version 1.25 or
later should work; older versions may also work.  If you do not modify
parser sources, releases contain the Bison-generated files and you do
not need Bison installed to build them.

When building from CVS or snapshots, or if you modify Texinfo
documentation, you need version 4.1 or later of Texinfo installed if you
want Info documentation to be regenerated.  Releases contain Info
documentation pre-built for the unmodified documentation in the release.

@section Building a native compiler

For a native build issue the command @samp{make bootstrap}.  This
will build the entire GCC system, which includes the following steps:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Build host tools necessary to build the compiler such as texinfo, bison,
gperf.

@item
Build target tools for use by the compiler such as binutils (bfd,
binutils, gas, gprof, ld, and opcodes)
if they have been individually linked
or moved into the top level GCC source tree before configuring.

@item
Perform a 3-stage bootstrap of the compiler.

@item
Perform a comparison test of the stage2 and stage3 compilers.

@item
Build runtime libraries using the stage3 compiler from the previous step.

@end itemize

If you are short on disk space you might consider @samp{make
bootstrap-lean} instead.  This is identical to @samp{make
bootstrap} except that object files from the stage1 and
stage2 of the 3-stage bootstrap of the compiler are deleted as
soon as they are no longer needed.

If you want to save additional space during the bootstrap and in
the final installation as well, you can build the compiler binaries
without debugging information as in the following example.  This will save
roughly 40% of disk space both for the bootstrap and the final installation.
(Libraries will still contain debugging information.)

@example
     make CFLAGS='-O' LIBCFLAGS='-g -O2' \
       LIBCXXFLAGS='-g -O2 -fno-implicit-templates' bootstrap
@end example

If you wish to use non-default GCC flags when compiling the stage2 and
stage3 compilers, set @code{BOOT_CFLAGS} on the command line when doing
@samp{make bootstrap}.  Non-default optimization flags are less well
tested here than the default of @samp{-g -O2}, but should still work.
In a few cases, you may find that you need to specify special flags such
as @option{-msoft-float} here to complete the bootstrap; or, if the
native compiler miscompiles the stage1 compiler, you may need to work
around this, by choosing @code{BOOT_CFLAGS} to avoid the parts of the
stage1 compiler that were miscompiled, or by using @samp{make
bootstrap4} to increase the number of stages of bootstrap.

If you used the flag @option{--enable-languages=@dots{}} to restrict
the compilers to be built, only those you've actually enabled will be
built.  This will of course only build those runtime libraries, for
which the particular compiler has been built.  Please note,
that re-defining @env{LANGUAGES} when calling @samp{make bootstrap}
@strong{does not} work anymore!

If the comparison of stage2 and stage3 fails, this normally indicates
that the stage2 compiler has compiled GCC incorrectly, and is therefore
a potentially serious bug which you should investigate and report.  (On
a few systems, meaningful comparison of object files is impossible; they
always appear ``different''.  If you encounter this problem, you will
need to disable comparison in the @file{Makefile}.)

@section Building a cross compiler

We recommend reading the
@uref{http://www.objsw.com/CrossGCC/,,crossgcc FAQ}
for information about building cross compilers.

When building a cross compiler, it is not generally possible to do a
3-stage bootstrap of the compiler.  This makes for an interesting problem
as parts of GCC can only be built with GCC@.

To build a cross compiler, we first recommend building and installing a
native compiler.  You can then use the native GCC compiler to build the
cross compiler.  The installed native compiler needs to be GCC version
2.95 or later.

Assuming you have already installed a native copy of GCC and configured
your cross compiler, issue the command @command{make}, which performs the
following steps:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Build host tools necessary to build the compiler such as texinfo, bison,
gperf.

@item
Build target tools for use by the compiler such as binutils (bfd,
binutils, gas, gprof, ld, and opcodes)
if they have been individually linked or moved into the top level GCC source
tree before configuring.

@item
Build the compiler (single stage only).

@item
Build runtime libraries using the compiler from the previous step.
@end itemize

Note that if an error occurs in any step the make process will exit.

@section Building in parallel

If you have a multiprocessor system you can use @samp{make bootstrap
MAKE="make -j 2" -j 2} or just @samp{make -j 2 bootstrap}
for GNU Make 3.79 and above instead of just @samp{make bootstrap}
when building GCC@.  You can use a bigger number instead of two if
you like.  In most cases, it won't help to use a number bigger than
the number of processors in your machine.

@section Building the Ada compiler

In order to build GNAT, the Ada compiler, you need a working GNAT
compiler (GNAT version 3.13 or later, or GCC version 3.1 or later),
since the Ada front end is written in Ada (with some
GNAT-specific extensions), and GNU make.

However, you do not need a full installation of GNAT, just the GNAT
binary @file{gnat1}, a copy of @file{gnatbind}, and a compiler driver
which can deal with Ada input (by invoking the @file{gnat1} binary).
You can specify this compiler driver by setting the @env{ADAC}
environment variable at the configure step.  @command{configure} can
detect the driver automatically if it has got a common name such as
@command{gcc} or @command{gnatgcc}.  Of course, you still need a working
C compiler (the compiler driver can be different or not).
@command{configure} does not test whether the GNAT installation works
and has a sufficiently recent version; if too old a GNAT version is
installed, the build will fail unless @option{--enable-languages} is
used to disable building the Ada front end.

Additional build tools (such as @command{gnatmake}) or a working GNAT
run-time library installation are usually @emph{not} required.  However,
if you want to bootstrap the compiler using a minimal version of GNAT,
you have to issue the following commands before invoking @samp{make
bootstrap} (this assumes that you start with an unmodified and consistent
source distribution):

@example
    cd @var{srcdir}/gcc/ada
    touch treeprs.ads [es]info.h nmake.ad[bs]
@end example

At the moment, the GNAT library and several tools for GNAT are not built
by @samp{make bootstrap}.  You have to invoke
@samp{make gnatlib_and_tools} in the @file{@var{objdir}/gcc}
subdirectory before proceeding with the next steps.

For example, you can build a native Ada compiler by issuing the
following commands (assuming @command{make} is GNU make):

@example
    cd @var{objdir}
    @var{srcdir}/configure --enable-languages=c,ada
    cd @var{srcdir}/gcc/ada
    touch treeprs.ads [es]info.h nmake.ad[bs]
    cd @var{objdir}
    make bootstrap
    cd gcc
    make gnatlib_and_tools
    cd ..
@end example

Currently, when compiling the Ada front end, you cannot use the parallel
build feature described in the previous section.

@end ifnothtml
@cindex Testing
@cindex Installing GCC: Testing
@cindex Testsuite

Before you install GCC, we encourage you to run the testsuites and to
compare your results with results from a similar configuration that have
been submitted to the
@uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/,,gcc-testresults mailing list}.
This step is optional and may require you to download additional software,
but it can give you confidence in your new GCC installation or point out
problems before you install and start using your new GCC.

First, you must have @uref{download.html,,downloaded the testsuites}.
These are part of the full distribution, but if you downloaded the
``core'' compiler plus any front ends, you must download the testsuites
separately.

Second, you must have the testing tools installed.  This includes
a @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/,,current version of DejaGnu};
dejagnu 1.3 is not sufficient.
It also includes Tcl and Expect; the DejaGnu site has links to these.

Now you may need specific preparations:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The following environment variables may need to be set appropriately, as in
the following example (which assumes that DejaGnu has been installed
under @file{/usr/local}):

@example
     TCL_LIBRARY = /usr/local/share/tcl8.0
     DEJAGNULIBS = /usr/local/share/dejagnu
@end example

On systems such as Cygwin, these paths are required to be actual
paths, not mounts or links; presumably this is due to some lack of
portability in the DejaGnu code.

If the directories where @command{runtest} and @command{expect} were
installed are in the @env{PATH}, it should not be necessary to set these
environment variables.

@end itemize

Finally, you can run the testsuite (which may take a long time):
@example
     cd @var{objdir}; make -k check
@end example

The testing process will try to test as many components in the GCC
distribution as possible, including the C, C++, Objective-C and Fortran
compilers as well as the C++ and Java runtime libraries.

While running the testsuite, DejaGnu might emit messages resembling
@samp{WARNING: Couldn't find the global config file.} or 
@samp{WARNING: Couldn't find tool init file}.
These messages are harmless and do not affect the validity of the tests.

@section How can I run the test suite on selected tests?

As a first possibility to cut down the number of tests that are run it is
possible to use @samp{make check-gcc} or @samp{make check-g++}
in the @file{gcc} subdirectory of the object directory.  To further cut down the
tests the following is possible:

@example
    make check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS="execute.exp @var{other-options}"
@end example

This will run all @command{gcc} execute tests in the testsuite.

@example
    make check-g++ RUNTESTFLAGS="old-deja.exp=9805* @var{other-options}"
@end example

This will run the @command{g++} ``old-deja'' tests in the testsuite where the filename
matches @samp{9805*}.

The @file{*.exp} files are located in the testsuite directories of the GCC
source, the most important ones being @file{compile.exp},
@file{execute.exp}, @file{dg.exp} and @file{old-deja.exp}.
To get a list of the possible @file{*.exp} files, pipe the
output of @samp{make check} into a file and look at the
@samp{Running @dots{}  .exp} lines.

To run only the tests for a library, run @samp{make check} from the
the library's testsuite in a subdirectory of the object directory:
@file{libstdc++-v3/testsuite} or @file{libcgj/testsuite}.

@section Additional testing for Java Class Libraries

The @uref{http://sources.redhat.com/mauve/,,Mauve Project} provides
a suite of tests for the Java Class Libraries.  This suite can be run
as part of libgcj testing by specifying the location of the Mauve tree
when invoking @samp{make}, as in @samp{make MAUVEDIR=~/mauve check}.

@section How to interpret test results

After the testsuite has run you'll find various @file{*.sum} and @file{*.log}
files in the testsuite subdirectories.  The @file{*.log} files contain a
detailed log of the compiler invocations and the corresponding
results, the @file{*.sum} files summarize the results.  These summaries list
all the tests that have been run with a corresponding status code:

@itemize @bullet
@item
PASS: the test passed as expected
@item
XPASS: the test unexpectedly passed
@item
FAIL: the test unexpectedly failed
@item
XFAIL: the test failed as expected
@item
UNSUPPORTED: the test is not supported on this platform
@item
ERROR: the testsuite detected an error
@item
WARNING: the testsuite detected a possible problem
@end itemize

It is normal for some tests to report unexpected failures.  At the
current time our testing harness does not allow fine grained control
over whether or not a test is expected to fail.  We expect to fix this
problem in future releases.


@section Submitting test results

If you want to report the results to the GCC project, use the
@file{contrib/test_summary} shell script.  Start it in the @var{objdir} with

@example
    @var{srcdir}/contrib/test_summary -p your_commentary.txt \
        -m gcc-testresults@@gcc.gnu.org |sh
@end example

This script uses the @command{Mail} program to send the results, so
make sure it is in your @env{PATH}.  The file @file{your_commentary.txt} is
prepended to the testsuite summary and should contain any special
remarks you have on your results or your build environment.  Please
do not edit the testsuite result block or the subject line, as these
messages are automatically parsed and presented at the
@uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/testresults/,,GCC testresults} web
page.  Here you can also gather information on how specific tests
behave on different platforms and compare them with your results.  A
few failing testcases are possible even on released versions and you
should look here first if you think your results are unreasonable.

@chapter Installing GCC: Final installation
@end ifnothtml

Now that GCC has been built (and optionally tested), you can install it with
@example
cd @var{objdir}; make install
@end example

We strongly recommend to install into a target directory where there is
no previous version of GCC present.

That step completes the installation of GCC; user level binaries can
be found in @file{@var{prefix}/bin} where @var{prefix} is the value you
specified with the @option{--prefix} to configure (or @file{/usr/local}
by default).  (If you specified @option{--bindir}, that directory will
be used instead; otherwise, if you specified @option{--exec-prefix},
@file{@var{exec-prefix}/bin} will be used.)  Headers for the C++ and
Java libraries are installed in @file{@var{prefix}/include}; libraries
in @file{@var{libdir}} (normally @file{@var{prefix}/lib}); internal
parts of the compiler in @file{@var{libdir}/gcc-lib}; documentation in
info format in @file{@var{infodir}} (normally @file{@var{prefix}/info}).

When installing cross-compilers, GCC's executables
are not only installed into @file{@var{bindir}}, that
is, @file{@var{exec-prefix}/bin}, but additionally into
@file{@var{exec-prefix}/@var{target-alias}/bin}, if that directory
exists.  Typically, such @dfn{tooldirs} hold target-specific
binutils, including assembler and linker.

Installation into a temporary staging area or into a @command{chroot}
jail can be achieved with the command

@example
make DESTDIR=@var{path-to-rootdir} install
@end example

@noindent where @var{path-to-rootdir} is the absolute path of
a directory relative to which all installation paths will be
interpreted.  Note that the directory specified by @code{DESTDIR}
need not exist yet; it will be created if necessary.

There is a subtle point with tooldirs and @code{DESTDIR}:
If you relocate a cross-compiler installation with
e.g.@: @samp{DESTDIR=@var{rootdir}}, then the directory
@file{@var{rootdir}/@var{exec-prefix}/@var{target-alias}/bin} will
be filled with duplicated GCC executables only if it already exists,
it will not be created otherwise.  This is regarded as a feature,
not as a bug, because it gives slightly more control to the packagers
using the @code{DESTDIR} feature.

If you built a released version of GCC using @samp{make bootstrap} then please
quickly review the build status page for your release, available from
@uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/buildstat.html}.
If your system is not listed for the version of GCC that you built,
send a note to
@email{gcc@@gcc.gnu.org} indicating
that you successfully built and installed GCC.
Include the following information:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Output from running @file{@var{srcdir}/config.guess}.  Do not send us
that file itself, just the one-line output from running it.

@item
The output of @samp{gcc -v} for your newly installed gcc.
This tells us which version of GCC you built and the options you passed to
configure.

@item
Whether you enabled all languages or a subset of them.  If you used a
full distribution then this information is part of the configure
options in the output of @samp{gcc -v}, but if you downloaded the
``core'' compiler plus additional front ends then it isn't apparent
which ones you built unless you tell us about it.

@item
If the build was for GNU/Linux, also include:
@itemize @bullet
@item
The distribution name and version (e.g., Red Hat 7.1 or Debian 2.2.3);
this information should be available from @file{/etc/issue}.

@item
The version of the Linux kernel, available from @samp{uname --version}
or @samp{uname -a}.

@item
The version of glibc you used; for RPM-based systems like Red Hat,
Mandrake, and SuSE type @samp{rpm -q glibc} to get the glibc version,
and on systems like Debian and Progeny use @samp{dpkg -l libc6}.
@end itemize
For other systems, you can include similar information if you think it is
relevant.

@item
Any other information that you think would be useful to people building
GCC on the same configuration.  The new entry in the build status list
will include a link to the archived copy of your message.
@end itemize

We'd also like to know if the
@ifnothtml
@ref{Specific, host/target specific installation notes}
@end ifnothtml
@ifhtml
@uref{specific.html,,host/target specific installation notes}
@end ifhtml
didn't include your host/target information or if that information is
incomplete or out of date.  Send a note to
@email{gcc@@gcc.gnu.org} telling us how the information should be changed.

If you find a bug, please report it following our
@uref{../bugs.html,,bug reporting guidelines}.

If you want to print the GCC manuals, do @samp{cd @var{objdir}; make
dvi}.  You will need to have @command{texi2dvi} (version at least 4.1)
and @TeX{} installed.  This creates a number of @file{.dvi} files in

We are often asked about pre-compiled versions of GCC@.  While we cannot
provide these for all platforms, below you'll find links to binaries for
various platforms where creating them by yourself is not easy due to various
reasons.

Please note that we did not create these binaries, nor do we
support them.  If you have any problems installing them, please

MIL-STD-1750A processors.  This target is obsoleted in GCC 3.1.

The MIL-STD-1750A cross configuration produces output for
@code{as1750}, an assembler/linker available under the GNU General Public
License for the 1750A@.  @code{as1750} can be obtained at
@uref{ftp://ftp.fta-berlin.de/pub/crossgcc/1750gals/}.
A similarly licensed simulator for
the 1750A is available from same address.

You should ignore a fatal error during the building of @samp{libgcc}
(@samp{libgcc} is not yet implemented for the 1750A@.)

The @code{as1750} assembler requires the file @file{ms1750.inc}, which is
found in the directory @file{gcc/config/1750a}.

GCC produced the same sections as the Fairchild F9450 C Compiler,
namely:

@table @code
@item Normal
The program code section.

@item Static
The read/write (RAM) data section.

@item Konst
The read-only (ROM) constants section.

@item Init
Initialization section (code to copy KREL to SREL)@.
@end table

The smallest addressable unit is 16 bits (@code{BITS_PER_UNIT} is 16).  This
means that type @code{char} is represented with a 16-bit word per character.
The 1750A's ``Load/Store Upper/Lower Byte'' instructions are not used by
GCC@.

section, please read all other sections that match your target.

We require binutils 2.11.2 or newer.
Previous binutils releases had a number of problems with DWARF 2
debugging information, not the least of which is incorrect linking of
shared libraries.

@heading @anchor{alpha*-dec-osf*}alpha*-dec-osf*
Systems using processors that implement the DEC Alpha architecture and
are running the DEC/Compaq Unix (DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX, or Compaq
Tru64 UNIX) operating system, for example the DEC Alpha AXP systems.

Support for versions before @code{alpha*-dec-osf4} is obsoleted in GCC
3.1.  (These are the versions which identify themselves as DEC OSF/1.)

In Digital Unix V4.0, virtual memory exhausted bootstrap failures
may be fixed by configuring with @option{--with-gc=simple},
reconfiguring Kernel Virtual Memory and Swap parameters
per the @command{/usr/sbin/sys_check} Tuning Suggestions,
or applying the patch in
@uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2002-08/msg00822.html}.

In Tru64 UNIX V5.1, Compaq introduced a new assembler that does not
currently (2001-06-13) work with @command{mips-tfile}.  As a workaround,
we need to use the old assembler, invoked via the barely documented
@option{-oldas} option.  To bootstrap GCC, you either need to use the
Compaq C Compiler:

@example
   % CC=cc @var{srcdir}/configure [@var{options}] [@var{target}]
@end example

or you can use a copy of GCC 2.95.3 or higher built on Tru64 UNIX V4.0:

@example
   % CC=gcc -Wa,-oldas @var{srcdir}/configure [@var{options}] [@var{target}]
@end example

As of GNU binutils 2.11.2, neither GNU @command{as} nor GNU @command{ld}
are supported on Tru64 UNIX, so you must not configure GCC with
@option{--with-gnu-as} or @option{--with-gnu-ld}.

The @option{--enable-threads} options isn't supported yet.  A patch is
in preparation for a future release.

GCC writes a @samp{.verstamp} directive to the assembler output file
unless it is built as a cross-compiler.  It gets the version to use from
the system header file @file{/usr/include/stamp.h}.  If you install a
new version of DEC Unix, you should rebuild GCC to pick up the new version
stamp.

Note that since the Alpha is a 64-bit architecture, cross-compilers from
32-bit machines will not generate code as efficient as that generated
when the compiler is running on a 64-bit machine because many
optimizations that depend on being able to represent a word on the
target in an integral value on the host cannot be performed.  Building
cross-compilers on the Alpha for 32-bit machines has only been tested in
a few cases and may not work properly.

@code{make compare} may fail on old versions of DEC Unix unless you add
@option{-save-temps} to @code{CFLAGS}.  On these systems, the name of the
assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
comparison fail if it differs between the @code{stage1} and
@code{stage2} compilations.  The option @option{-save-temps} forces a
fixed name to be used for the assembler input file, instead of a
randomly chosen name in @file{/tmp}.  Do not add @option{-save-temps}
unless the comparisons fail without that option.  If you add
@option{-save-temps}, you will have to manually delete the @samp{.i} and
@samp{.s} files after each series of compilations.

GCC now supports both the native (ECOFF) debugging format used by DBX
and GDB and an encapsulated STABS format for use only with GDB@.  See the
discussion of the @option{--with-stabs} option of @file{configure} above
for more information on these formats and how to select them.

There is a bug in DEC's assembler that produces incorrect line numbers
for ECOFF format when the @samp{.align} directive is used.  To work
around this problem, GCC will not emit such alignment directives
while writing ECOFF format debugging information even if optimization is
being performed.  Unfortunately, this has the very undesirable
side-effect that code addresses when @option{-O} is specified are
different depending on whether or not @option{-g} is also specified.

To avoid this behavior, specify @option{-gstabs+} and use GDB instead of
DBX@.  DEC is now aware of this problem with the assembler and hopes to
provide a fix shortly.

@heading @anchor{alphaev5-cray-unicosmk*}alphaev5-cray-unicosmk*
Cray T3E systems running Unicos/Mk.

This port is incomplete and has many known bugs.  We hope to improve the
support for this target soon.  Currently, only the C front end is supported,
and it is not possible to build parallel applications.  Cray modules are not
supported; in particular, Craylibs are assumed to be in
@file{/opt/ctl/craylibs/craylibs}.

You absolutely @strong{must} use GNU make on this platform.  Also, you
need to tell GCC where to find the assembler and the linker.  The
simplest way to do so is by providing @option{--with-as} and
@option{--with-ld} to @file{configure}, e.g.@:

@example
    configure --with-as=/opt/ctl/bin/cam --with-ld=/opt/ctl/bin/cld \
      --enable-languages=c
@end example

The comparison test during @samp{make bootstrap} fails on Unicos/Mk
because the assembler inserts timestamps into object files.  You should
be able to work around this by doing @samp{make all} after getting this
failure.

The version of binutils installed in @file{/usr/bin} is known to work unless
otherwise specified in any per-architecture notes.  However, binutils
2.12.1 or greater is known to improve overall testsuite results.

For FreeBSD 1, FreeBSD 2 or any mutant a.out versions of FreeBSD 3: All
configuration support and files as shipped with GCC 2.95 are still in
place.  FreeBSD 2.2.7 has been known to bootstrap completely; however,
it is unknown which version of binutils was used (it is assumed that it
was the system copy in @file{/usr/bin}) and C++ EH failures were noted.

Support for FreeBSD 1 is obsoleted in GCC 3.1.

For FreeBSD using the ELF file format: DWARF 2 debugging is now the
default for all CPU architectures.  It had been the default on
FreeBSD/alpha since its inception.  You may use @option{-gstabs} instead
of @option{-g}, if you really want the old debugging format.  There are
no known issues with mixing object files and libraries with different
debugging formats.  Otherwise, this release of GCC should now match more
of the configuration used in the stock FreeBSD configuration of GCC.  In
particular, @option{--enable-threads} is now configured by default.
However, as a general user, do not attempt to replace the system
compiler with this release.  Known to bootstrap and check with good
results on FreeBSD 3.0, 3.4, 4.0, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5-STABLE and 5-CURRENT@.

In principle, @option{--enable-threads} is now compatible with
@option{--enable-libgcj} on FreeBSD@.  However, it has only been built
and tested on @samp{i386-*-freebsd4.5} and @samp{alpha-*-freebsd5.0}.
The static
library may be incorrectly built (symbols are missing at link time).
There is a rare timing-based startup hang (probably involves an
assupmtion about the thread library).  Multi-threaded boehm-gc (required for
libjava) exposes severe threaded signal-handling bugs on FreeBSD before
4.5-RELEASE.  The alpha port may not fully bootstrap without some manual
intervention: @command{gcjh} will crash with a floating-point exception while
generating @file{java/lang/Double.h} (just copy the version built on
@samp{i386-*-freebsd*} and rerun the top-level @command{gmake} with no
arguments and it
should properly complete the bootstrap).  Other CPU architectures
supported by FreeBSD will require additional configuration tuning in, at
the very least, both boehm-gc and libffi.

Shared @file{libgcc_s.so} is now built and installed by default.

We @emph{highly} recommend using gas/binutils 2.8 or newer on all hppa
platforms; you may encounter a variety of problems when using the HP
assembler.  The HP assembler does not work with the @samp{hppa64-hp-hpux11*}
port.

Specifically, @option{-g} does not work on HP-UX (since that system
uses a peculiar debugging format which GCC does not know about), unless you
use GAS and GDB and configure GCC with the
@uref{./configure.html#with-gnu-as,,@option{--with-gnu-as}} and
@option{--with-as=@dots{}} options.

If you wish to use the pa-risc 2.0 architecture support with a 32-bit

The HP assembler has major problems on this platform.  We've tried to work
around the worst of the problems.  However, those workarounds may be causing

shared libraries from working.  Use the GNU assembler to avoid these problems.


The configuration scripts for GCC will also trigger a bug in the hpux9

are two distinct ports.  The @samp{hppa2.0w-hp-hpux11*} port generates
code for the 32-bit pa-risc runtime architecture.  It uses the HP

must be used if both ports are to be installed on the same system.

GNU binutils 2.13 or later is recommended with the 64-bit port.
The HP assembler is not supported.  It is @emph{highly} recommended
that the GNU linker be used as well.  Either binutils must be built
prior to gcc, or a binary distribution of gcc or binutils must be
obtained for the initial builds.  When starting with a HP compiler,
it is preferable to use the ANSI compiler as the bundled compiler
only supports traditional C.  Bootstrapping with the bundled compiler
is tested infrequently and problems often arise because of the subtle
differences in semantics between traditional and ISO C.  There also
have been problems reported with various binary distributions.  This
port still is undergoing significant development.

Use this for the SCO OpenServer Release 5 family of operating systems.

Unlike earlier versions of GCC, the ability to generate COFF with this
target is no longer provided.

Earlier versions of GCC emitted DWARF 1 when generating ELF to allow
the system debugger to be used.  That support was too burdensome to
maintain.  GCC now emits only DWARF 2 for this target.  This means you
may use either the UDK debugger or GDB to debug programs built by this
version of GCC@.

Use of the @option{-march=pentiumpro} flag can result in
unrecognized opcodes when using the native assembler on OS versions before
5.0.6.  (Support for P6 opcodes was added to the native ELF assembler in
that version.)  While it's rather rare to see these emitted by GCC yet,
errors of the basic form:

@example
  /usr/tmp/ccaNlqBc.s:22:unknown instruction: fcomip
  /usr/tmp/ccaNlqBc.s:50:unknown instruction: fucomip
@end example

are symptoms of this problem.  You may work around this by not
building affected files with that flag, by using the GNU assembler, or
by using the assembler provided with the current version of the OS@.
Users of GNU assembler should see the note below for hazards on doing
so.

The native SCO assembler that is provided with the OS at no
charge is normally required.  If, however, you must be able to use
the GNU assembler (perhaps you're compiling code with asms that
require GAS syntax) you may configure this package using the flags
@uref{./configure.html#with-gnu-as,,@option{--with-gnu-as}}.  You must
use a recent version of GNU binutils; versions past 2.9.1 seem to work
well.

In general, the @option{--with-gnu-as} option isn't as well tested
as the native assembler.

Look in @file{gcc/config/i386/sco5.h} (search for ``messy'') for
additional OpenServer-specific flags.

Systems based on OpenServer before 5.0.4 (@samp{uname -X}
will tell you what you're running) require TLS597 from
@uref{ftp://ftp.sco.com/TLS/,,ftp://ftp.sco.com/TLS/}
for C++ constructors and destructors to work right.

The system linker in (at least) 5.0.4 and 5.0.5 will sometimes
do the wrong thing for a construct that GCC will emit for PIC
code.  This can be seen as execution testsuite failures when using
@option{-fPIC} on @file{921215-1.c}, @file{931002-1.c}, @file{nestfunc-1.c}, and @file{gcov-1.c}.
For 5.0.5, an updated linker that will cure this problem is
available.  You must install both
@uref{ftp://ftp.sco.com/Supplements/rs505a/,,ftp://ftp.sco.com/Supplements/rs505a/}
and @uref{ftp://ftp.sco.com/SLS/,,OSS499A}.

The dynamic linker in OpenServer 5.0.5 (earlier versions may show
the same problem) aborts on certain G77-compiled programs.  It's particularly
likely to be triggered by building Fortran code with the @option{-fPIC} flag.
Although it's conceivable that the error could be triggered by other
code, only G77-compiled code has been observed to cause this abort.
If you are getting core dumps immediately upon execution of your
G77 program---and especially if it's compiled with @option{-fPIC}---try applying
@uref{sco_osr5_g77.patch,,@file{sco_osr5_g77.patch}} to your @samp{libf2c} and
rebuilding GCC@.
Affected faults, when analyzed in a debugger, will show a stack
backtrace with a fault occurring in @code{rtld()} and the program
running as @file{/usr/lib/ld.so.1}.  This problem has been reported to SCO
engineering and will hopefully be addressed in later releases.

This target emulates the SCO Universal Development Kit and requires that
package be installed.  (If it is installed, you will have a
@file{/udk/usr/ccs/bin/cc} file present.)  It's very much like the
@samp{i?86-*-unixware7*} target
but is meant to be used when hosting on a system where UDK isn't the
default compiler such as OpenServer 5 or Unixware 2.  This target will
generate binaries that will run on OpenServer, Unixware 2, or Unixware 7,
with the same warnings and caveats as the SCO UDK@.

This target is a little tricky to build because we have to distinguish
it from the native tools (so it gets headers, startups, and libraries
from the right place) while making the tools not think we're actually
building a cross compiler.   The easiest way to do this is with a configure
command like this:

@example
    CC=/udk/usr/ccs/bin/cc @var{/your/path/to}/gcc/configure \
      --host=i686-pc-udk --target=i686-pc-udk --program-prefix=udk-
@end example

@emph{You should substitute @samp{i686} in the above command with the appropriate
processor for your host.}

After the usual @samp{make bootstrap} and
@samp{make install}, you can then access the UDK-targeted GCC
tools by adding @command{udk-} before the commonly known name.  For
example, to invoke the C compiler, you would use @command{udk-gcc}.
They will coexist peacefully with any native-target GCC tools you may
have installed.

AIX Make frequently has problems with GCC makefiles.  GNU Make 3.76 or
newer is recommended to build on this platform.

Errors involving @code{alloca} when building GCC generally are due
to an incorrect definition of @code{CC} in the Makefile or mixing files
compiled with the native C compiler and GCC@.  During the stage1 phase of
the build, the native AIX compiler @strong{must} be invoked as @command{cc}
(not @command{xlc}).  Once @command{configure} has been informed of
@command{xlc}, one needs to use @samp{make distclean} to remove the
configure cache files and ensure that @env{CC} environment variable
does not provide a definition that will confuse @command{configure}.
If this error occurs during stage2 or later, then the problem most likely
is the version of Make (see above).

The GNU Assembler incorrectly reports that it supports WEAK symbols on
AIX which causes GCC to try to utilize weak symbol functionality which
is not really supported on the platform.  The native @command{as} and
@command{ld} still are recommended.  The native AIX tools do
interoperate with GCC@.

Building @file{libstdc++.a} requires a fix for a AIX Assembler bug
APAR IY26685 (AIX 4.3) or APAR IY25528 (AIX 5.1).

@samp{libstdc++} in GCC 3.2 increments the major version number of the
shared object and GCC installation places the @file{libstdc++.a}
shared library in a common location which will overwrite the GCC 3.1
version of the shared library.  Applications either need to be
re-linked against the new shared library or the GCC 3.1 version of the
@samp{libstdc++} shared object needs to be available to the AIX
runtime loader.  The GCC 3.1 @samp{libstdc++.so.4} shared object can
be installed for runtime dynamic loading using the following steps to
set the @samp{F_LOADONLY} flag in the shared object for @emph{each}
multilib @file{libstdc++.a} installed:

Extract the shared object from each the GCC 3.1 @file{libstdc++.a}
archive:
@example
   % ar -x libstdc++.a libstdc++.so.4
@end example

Enable the @samp{F_LOADONLY} flag so that the shared object will be
available for runtime dynamic loading, but not linking:
@example
   % strip -e libstdc++.so.4
@end example

Archive the runtime-only shared object in the GCC 3.2
@file{libstdc++.a} archive:
@example
   % ar -q libstdc++.a libstdc++.so.4
@end example

Linking executables and shared libraries may produce warnings of
duplicate symbols.  The assembly files generated by GCC for AIX always
have included multiple symbol definitions for certain global variable
and function declarations in the original program.  The warnings should
not prevent the linker from producing a correct library or runnable
executable.

AIX 4.3 utilizes a ``large format'' archive to support both 32-bit and
64-bit object modules.  The routines provided in AIX 4.3.0 and AIX 4.3.1
to parse archive libraries did not handle the new format correctly.
These routines are used by GCC and result in error messages during
linking such as ``not a COFF file''.  The version of the routines shipped
with AIX 4.3.1 should work for a 32-bit environment.  The @option{-g}
option of the archive command may be used to create archives of 32-bit
objects using the original ``small format''.  A correct version of the
routines is shipped with AIX 4.3.2 and above.

Some versions of the AIX binder (linker) can fail with a relocation
overflow severe error when the @option{-bbigtoc} option is used to link
GCC-produced object files into an executable that overflows the TOC@.  A fix
for APAR IX75823 (OVERFLOW DURING LINK WHEN USING GCC AND -BBIGTOC) is
available from IBM Customer Support and from its
@uref{http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/,,techsupport.services.ibm.com}
website as PTF U455193.

The AIX 4.3.2.1 linker (bos.rte.bind_cmds Level 4.3.2.1) will dump core
with a segmentation fault when invoked by any version of GCC@.  A fix for
APAR IX87327 is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
@uref{http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/,,techsupport.services.ibm.com}
website as PTF U461879.  This fix is incorporated in AIX 4.3.3 and above.

The initial assembler shipped with AIX 4.3.0 generates incorrect object
files.  A fix for APAR IX74254 (64BIT DISASSEMBLED OUTPUT FROM COMPILER FAILS
TO ASSEMBLE/BIND) is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
@uref{http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/,,techsupport.services.ibm.com}
website as PTF U453956.  This fix is incorporated in AIX 4.3.1 and above.

AIX provides National Language Support (NLS)@.  Compilers and assemblers
use NLS to support locale-specific representations of various data
formats including floating-point numbers (e.g., @samp{.}  vs @samp{,} for
separating decimal fractions).  There have been problems reported where
GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats that the assembler
expects.  If one encounters this problem, set the @env{LANG}
environment variable to @samp{C} or @samp{En_US}.

By default, GCC for AIX 4.1 and above produces code that can be used on
both Power or PowerPC processors.

A default can be specified with the @option{-mcpu=@var{cpu_type}}
switch and using the configure option @option{--with-cpu-@var{cpu_type}}.

Use @samp{configure unos} for building on Unos.

The Unos assembler is named @code{casm} instead of @code{as}.  For some
strange reason linking @file{/bin/as} to @file{/bin/casm} changes the
behavior, and does not work.  So, when installing GCC, you should
install the following script as @file{as} in the subdirectory where
the passes of GCC are installed:

@example
#!/bin/sh
casm $*
@end example

The default Unos library is named @file{libunos.a} instead of
@file{libc.a}.  To allow GCC to function, either change all
references to @option{-lc} in @file{gcc.c} to @option{-lunos} or link
@file{/lib/libc.a} to @file{/lib/libunos.a}.

@cindex @code{alloca}, for Unos
When compiling GCC with the standard compiler, to overcome bugs in
the support of @code{alloca}, do not use @option{-O} when making stage 2.
Then use the stage 2 compiler with @option{-O} to make the stage 3
compiler.  This compiler will have the same characteristics as the usual
stage 2 compiler on other systems.  Use it to make a stage 4 compiler
and compare that with stage 3 to verify proper compilation.

(Perhaps simply defining @code{ALLOCA} in @file{x-crds} as described in
the comments there will make the above paragraph superfluous.  Please
inform us of whether this works.)

Unos uses memory segmentation instead of demand paging, so you will need
a lot of memory.  5 Mb is barely enough if no other tasks are running.
If linking @file{cc1} fails, try putting the object files into a library
and linking from that library.

HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX@.  HP-UX version 8.0 has a bug in
the assembler that prevents compilation of GCC@.  This
bug manifests itself during the first stage of compilation, while
building @file{libgcc2.a}:

@smallexample
_floatdisf
cc1: warning: `-g' option not supported on this version of GCC
cc1: warning: `-g1' option not supported on this version of GCC
./xgcc: Internal compiler error: program as got fatal signal 11
@end smallexample

A patched version of the assembler is available as the file
@uref{ftp://altdorf.ai.mit.edu/archive/cph/hpux-8.0-assembler}.  If you
have HP software support, the patch can also be obtained directly from
HP, as described in the following note:

@quotation
This is the patched assembler, to patch SR#1653-010439, where the
assembler aborts on floating point constants.

The bug is not really in the assembler, but in the shared library
version of the function ``cvtnum(3c)''.  The bug on ``cvtnum(3c)'' is
SR#4701-078451.  Anyway, the attached assembler uses the archive
library version of ``cvtnum(3c)'' and thus does not exhibit the bug.
@end quotation

This patch is also known as PHCO_4484.

In addition, if you wish to use gas, you must use
gas version 2.1 or later, and you must use the GNU linker version 2.1 or
later.  Earlier versions of gas relied upon a program which converted the
gas output into the native HP-UX format, but that program has not been
kept up to date.  gdb does not understand that native HP-UX format, so
you must use gas if you wish to use gdb.

On HP-UX version 8.05, but not on 8.07 or more recent versions, the
@code{fixproto} shell script triggers a bug in the system shell.  If you
encounter this problem, upgrade your operating system or use BASH (the
GNU shell) to run @code{fixproto}.  This bug will cause the fixproto
program to report an error of the form:

@example
./fixproto: sh internal 1K buffer overflow
@end example

To fix this, you can also change the first line of the fixproto script
to look like:

@example
#!/bin/ksh
@end example

These configurations are obsoleted in GCC 3.1.

Current GCC versions probably do not work on version 2 of the NeXT
operating system.

On NeXTStep 3.0, the Objective-C compiler does not work, due,
apparently, to a kernel bug that it happens to trigger.  This problem
does not happen on 3.1.

You absolutely @strong{must} use GNU sed and GNU make on this platform.


On NeXTSTEP 3.x where x < 3 the build of GCC will abort during
stage1 with an error message like this:

@example
  _eh
  /usr/tmp/ccbbsZ0U.s:987:Unknown pseudo-op: .section
  /usr/tmp/ccbbsZ0U.s:987:Rest of line ignored. 1st junk character
  valued 95 (_).
@end example

The reason for this is the fact that NeXT's assembler for these
versions of the operating system does not support the @samp{.section}
pseudo op that's needed for full C++ exception functionality.

As NeXT's assembler is a derived work from GNU as, a free
replacement that does can be obtained at
@uref{ftp://ftp.next.peak.org:/next-ftp/next/apps/devtools/as.3.3.NIHS.s.tar.gz,,ftp://ftp.next.peak.org:/next-ftp/next/apps/devtools/as.3.3.NIHS.s.tar.gz}.

If you try to build the integrated C++ & C++ runtime libraries on this system
you will run into trouble with include files.  The way to get around this is
to use the following sequence.  Note you must have write permission to
the directory @var{prefix} you specified in the configuration process of GCC
for this sequence to work.

@example
  cd bld-gcc
  make all-texinfo all-bison all-byacc all-binutils all-gas all-ld

If you use the 1.31 version of the MIPS assembler (such as was shipped
with Ultrix 3.1), you will need to use the @option{-fno-delayed-branch} switch
when optimizing floating point code.  Otherwise, the assembler will
complain when the GCC compiler fills a branch delay slot with a
floating point instruction, such as @code{add.d}.

If on a MIPS system you get an error message saying ``does not have gp
sections for all it's [sic] sectons [sic]'', don't worry about it.  This
happens whenever you use GAS with the MIPS linker, but there is not
really anything wrong, and it is okay to use the output file.  You can
stop such warnings by installing the GNU linker.

It would be nice to extend GAS to produce the gp tables, but they are
optional, and there should not be a warning about their absence.

Users have reported some problems with version 2.0 of the MIPS
compiler tools that were shipped with Ultrix 4.1.  Version 2.10
which came with Ultrix 4.2 seems to work fine.

Users have also reported some problems with version 2.20 of the
MIPS compiler tools that were shipped with RISC/os 4.x.  The earlier
version 2.11 seems to work fine.

Some versions of the MIPS linker will issue an assertion failure
when linking code that uses @code{alloca} against shared
libraries on RISC-OS 5.0, and DEC's OSF/1 systems.  This is a bug
in the linker, that is supposed to be fixed in future revisions.
To protect against this, GCC passes @option{-non_shared} to the
linker unless you pass an explicit @option{-shared} or
@option{-call_shared} switch.

It's possible that some old versions of the system lack the functions

If you use the MIPS C compiler to bootstrap, it may be necessary
to increase its table size for switch statements with the

Both of these options are automatically generated in the

This configuration is obsoleted in GCC 3.1.

In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 4, the ``c.hdr.lib''
option must be installed from the CD-ROM supplied from Silicon Graphics.
This is found on the 2nd CD in release 4.0.1.

On IRIX version 4.0.5F, and perhaps on some other versions as well,
there is an assembler bug that reorders instructions incorrectly.  To
work around it, specify the target configuration
@samp{mips-sgi-irix4loser}.  This configuration inhibits assembler
optimization.

In a compiler configured with target @samp{mips-sgi-irix4}, you can turn
off assembler optimization by using the @option{-noasmopt} option.  This
compiler option passes the option @option{-O0} to the assembler, to
inhibit reordering.

The @option{-noasmopt} option can be useful for testing whether a problem
is due to erroneous assembler reordering.  Even if a problem does not go
away with @option{-noasmopt}, it may still be due to assembler
reordering---perhaps GCC itself was miscompiled as a result.

You may get the following warning on IRIX 4 platforms, it can be safely
ignored.
@example
  warning: foo.o does not have gp tables for all its sections.
@end example

@heading @anchor{mips-sgi-irix5}mips-sgi-irix5

This configuration has considerable problems, which will be fixed in a
future release.

In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 5, the ``compiler_dev.hdr''
subsystem must be installed from the IDO CD-ROM supplied by Silicon
Graphics.  It is also available for download from
@uref{http://www.sgi.com/developers/devtools/apis/ido.html,,http://www.sgi.com/developers/devtools/apis/ido.html}.

@code{make compare} may fail on version 5 of IRIX unless you add
@option{-save-temps} to @code{CFLAGS}.  On these systems, the name of the
assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
comparison fail if it differs between the @code{stage1} and
@code{stage2} compilations.  The option @option{-save-temps} forces a
fixed name to be used for the assembler input file, instead of a
randomly chosen name in @file{/tmp}.  Do not add @option{-save-temps}
unless the comparisons fail without that option.  If you do you
@option{-save-temps}, you will have to manually delete the @samp{.i} and
@samp{.s} files after each series of compilations.

If you use the MIPS C compiler to bootstrap, it may be necessary
to increase its table size for switch statements with the
@option{-Wf,-XNg1500} option.  If you use the @option{-O2}
optimization option, you also need to use @option{-Olimit 3000}.

To enable debugging under IRIX 5, you must use GNU @command{as} 2.11.2
or later,
and use the @option{--with-gnu-as} configure option when configuring GCC.
GNU @command{as} is distributed as part of the binutils package.
When using release 2.11.2, you need to apply a patch
@uref{http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2001-07/msg00352.html,,http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2001-07/msg00352.html}
which will be included in the next release of binutils.

When building GCC, the build process loops rebuilding @command{cc1} over
and over again.  This happens on @samp{mips-sgi-irix5.2}, and possibly
other platforms.  It has been reported that this is a known bug in the
@command{make} shipped with IRIX 5.2.  We recommend you use GNU
@command{make} instead of the vendor supplied @command{make} program;
however, you may have success with @command{smake} on IRIX 5.2 if you do
not have GNU @command{make} available.

@heading @anchor{mips-sgi-irix6}mips-sgi-irix6

If you are using IRIX @command{cc} as your bootstrap compiler, you must
ensure that the N32 ABI is in use.  To test this, compile a simple C
file with @command{cc} and then run @command{file} on the
resulting object file.  The output should look like:

@example
test.o: ELF N32 MSB @dots{}
@end example

If you see:

@example
test.o: ELF 32-bit MSB @dots{}
@end example

or

@example
test.o: ELF 64-bit MSB @dots{}
@end example

then your version of @command{cc} uses the O32 or N64 ABI by default.  You
should set the environment variable @env{CC} to @samp{cc -n32}
before configuring GCC@.

If you want the resulting @command{gcc} to run on old 32-bit systems
with the MIPS R4400 CPU, you need to ensure that only code for the mips3
instruction set architecture (ISA) is generated.  While GCC 3.x does
this correctly, both GCC 2.95 and SGI's MIPSpro @command{cc} may change
the ISA depending on the machine where GCC is built.  Using one of them
as the bootstrap compiler may result in mips4 code, which won't run at
all on mips3-only systems.  For the test program above, you should see:

@example
test.o: ELF N32 MSB mips-3 @dots{}
@end example

If you get:

@example
test.o: ELF N32 MSB mips-4 @dots{}
@end example

instead, you should set the environment variable @env{CC} to @samp{cc
-n32 -mips3} or @samp{gcc -mips3} respectively before configuring GCC@.

GCC on IRIX 6 is usually built to support both the N32 and N64 ABIs.  If
you build GCC on a system that doesn't have the N64 libraries installed,
you need to configure with @option{--disable-multilib} so GCC doesn't
try to use them.  Look for @file{/usr/lib64/libc.so.1} to see if you
have the 64-bit libraries installed.

You must @emph{not} use GNU @command{as} (which isn't built anyway as of
binutils 2.11.2) on IRIX 6 platforms; doing so will only cause problems.

GCC does not currently support generating O32 ABI binaries in the
@samp{mips-sgi-irix6} configurations.  It is possible to create a GCC
with O32 ABI only support by configuring it for the @samp{mips-sgi-irix5}
target and using a patched GNU @command{as} 2.11.2 as documented in the
@uref{#mips-sgi-irix5,,@samp{mips-sgi-irix5}} section above.  Using the
native assembler requires patches to GCC which will be included in a
future release.  It is
expected that O32 ABI support will be available again in a future release.

The @option{--enable-threads} option doesn't currently work, a patch is
in preparation for a future release.  The @option{--enable-libgcj}
option is disabled by default: IRIX 6 uses a very low default limit
(20480) for the command line length.  Although libtool contains a
workaround for this problem, at least the N64 @samp{libgcj} is known not
to build despite this, running into an internal error of the native
@command{ld}.  A sure fix is to increase this limit (@samp{ncargs}) to
its maximum of 262144 bytes.  If you have root access, you can use the
@command{systune} command to do this.

GCC does not correctly pass/return structures which are
smaller than 16 bytes and which are not 8 bytes.  The problem is very
involved and difficult to fix.  It affects a number of other targets also,
but IRIX 6 is affected the most, because it is a 64-bit target, and 4 byte
structures are common.  The exact problem is that structures are being padded
at the wrong end, e.g.@: a 4 byte structure is loaded into the lower 4 bytes
of the register when it should be loaded into the upper 4 bytes of the
register.

GCC is consistent with itself, but not consistent with the SGI C compiler
(and the SGI supplied runtime libraries), so the only failures that can
happen are when there are library functions that take/return such
structures. There are very few such library functions.  Currently this
is known to affect @code{inet_ntoa}, @code{inet_lnaof},
@code{inet_netof}, @code{inet_makeaddr}, and @code{semctl}.  Until the
bug is fixed, GCC contains workarounds for the known affected functions.

See @uref{http://freeware.sgi.com/,,http://freeware.sgi.com/} for more
information about using GCC on IRIX platforms.

PowerPC running Darwin (Mac OS X kernel).

GCC 3.0 does not support Darwin, but 3.1 and later releases will work.

Pre-installed versions of Mac OS X may not include any developer tools,
meaning that you will not be able to build GCC from source.  Tool
binaries are available at
@uref{http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/darwin} (free
registration required).

Versions of the assembler prior to ``cctools-364'' cannot handle the
4-argument form of @code{rlwinm} and related mask-using instructions.  Darwin
1.3 (Mac OS X 10.0) uses cctools-353 for instance.  To get cctools-364,
check out @file{cctools} with tag @samp{Apple-364}, build it, and
install the assembler as @file{usr/bin/as}.  See
@uref{http://www.opensource.apple.com/tools/cvs/docs.html} for details.

Also, the default stack limit of 512K is too small, and a bootstrap will
typically fail when self-compiling @file{expr.c}.  Set the stack to 800K
or more, for instance by doing @samp{limit stack 800}.  It's also
convenient to use the GNU preprocessor instead of Apple's during the
first stage of bootstrapping; this is automatic when doing @samp{make
bootstrap}, but to do it from the toplevel objdir you will need to say
@samp{make CC='cc -no-cpp-precomp' bootstrap}.

Note that the version of GCC shipped by Apple typically includes a
number of extensions not available in a standard GCC release.  These
extensions are generally specific to Mac programming.

These configurations are obsoleted in GCC 3.1.

We recommend you compile GCC with an earlier version of itself; if you
compile GCC with @command{hc}, the Metaware compiler, it will work, but
you will get mismatches between the stage 2 and stage 3 compilers in
various files.  These errors are minor differences in some
floating-point constants and can be safely ignored; the stage 3 compiler
is correct.

@c Please use Solaris 2 to refer to all release of Solaris, starting
@c with 2.0 until 2.6, 7, and 8.  Solaris 1 was a marketing name for
@c SunOS 4 releases which we don't use to avoid confusion.  Solaris
@c alone is too unspecific and must be avoided.
@heading @anchor{*-*-solaris2*}*-*-solaris2*

Sun does not ship a C compiler with Solaris 2.  To bootstrap and install
GCC you first have to install a pre-built compiler, see our
@uref{binaries.html,,binaries page} for details.

The Solaris 2 @command{/bin/sh} will often fail to configure
@file{libstdc++-v3}, @file{boehm-gc} or
@file{libjava}.  If you encounter this problem, set @env{CONFIG_SHELL} to
@command{/bin/ksh} in your environment before running @command{configure}.

Solaris 2 comes with a number of optional OS packages.  Some of these
packages are needed to use GCC fully, namely @code{SUNWarc},
@code{SUNWbtool}, @code{SUNWesu}, @code{SUNWhea}, @code{SUNWlibm},
@code{SUNWsprot}, and @code{SUNWtoo}.  If you did not install all
optional packages when installing Solaris 2, you will need to verify that
the packages that GCC needs are installed.

To check whether an optional package is installed, use
the @command{pkginfo} command.  To add an optional package, use the
@command{pkgadd} command.  For further details, see the Solaris 2
documentation.

Trying to use the linker and other tools in
@file{/usr/ucb} to install GCC has been observed to cause trouble.
For example, the linker may hang indefinitely.  The fix is to remove
@file{/usr/ucb} from your @env{PATH}.

All releases of GNU binutils prior to 2.11.2 have known bugs on this
platform.  We recommend the use of GNU binutils 2.11.2 or the vendor
tools (Sun @command{as}, Sun @command{ld}).

Sun bug 4296832 turns up when compiling X11 headers with GCC 2.95 or
newer: @command{g++} will complain that types are missing.  These headers assume
that omitting the type means @code{int}; this assumption worked for C89 but
is wrong for C++, and is now wrong for C99 also.

@command{g++} accepts such (invalid) constructs with the option
@option{-fpermissive}; it
will assume that any missing type is @code{int} (as defined by C89).

There are patches for Solaris 2.6 (105633-56 or newer for SPARC,
106248-42 or newer for Intel), Solaris 7 (108376-21 or newer for SPARC,
108377-20 for Intel), and Solaris 8 (108652-24 or newer for SPARC,
108653-22 for Intel) that fix this bug.

When GCC is configured to use binutils 2.11.2 or later the binaries
produced are smaller than the ones produced using Sun's native tools;
this difference is quite significant for binaries containing debugging
information.

Sun @command{as} 4.x is broken in that it cannot cope with long symbol names.
A typical error message might look similar to the following:

@smallexample
/usr/ccs/bin/as: "/var/tmp/ccMsw135.s", line 11041: error:
  can't compute value of an expression involving an external symbol.
@end smallexample

This is Sun bug 4237974.  This is fixed with patch 108908-02 for Solaris
2.6 and has been fixed in later (5.x) versions of the assembler,
starting with Solaris 7.

Starting with Solaris 7, the operating system is capable of executing
64-bit SPARC V9 binaries.  GCC 3.1 and later properly supports
this; the @option{-m64} option enables 64-bit code generation.
However, if all you want is code tuned for the UltraSPARC CPU, you
should try the @option{-mtune=ultrasparc} option instead, which produces
code that, unlike full 64-bit code, can still run on non-UltraSPARC
machines.

When configuring on a Solaris 7 or later system that is running a kernel
that supports only 32-bit binaries, one must configure with
@option{--disable-multilib}, since we will not be able to build the
64-bit target libraries.

Sun patch 107058-01 (1999-01-13) for Solaris 7/SPARC triggers a bug in
the dynamic linker.  This problem (Sun bug 4210064) affects GCC 2.8
and later, including all EGCS releases.  Sun formerly recommended
107058-01 for all Solaris 7 users, but around 1999-09-01 it started to
recommend it only for people who use Sun's compilers.

Here are some workarounds to this problem:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Do not install Sun patch 107058-01 until after Sun releases a
complete patch for bug 4210064.  This is the simplest course to take,
unless you must also use Sun's C compiler.  Unfortunately 107058-01
is preinstalled on some new Solaris 7-based hosts, so you may have to
back it out.

@item
Copy the original, unpatched Solaris 7
@command{/usr/ccs/bin/as} into
@command{/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/3.1/as},
adjusting the latter name to fit your local conventions and software
version numbers.

@item
Install Sun patch 106950-03 (1999-05-25) or later.  Nobody with
both 107058-01 and 106950-03 installed has reported the bug with GCC
and Sun's dynamic linker.  This last course of action is riskiest,
for two reasons.  First, you must install 106950 on all hosts that
run code generated by GCC; it doesn't suffice to install it only on
the hosts that run GCC itself.  Second, Sun says that 106950-03 is
only a partial fix for bug 4210064, but Sun doesn't know whether the
partial fix is adequate for GCC@.  Revision -08 or later should fix
the bug.  The current (as of 2001-09-24) revision is -14, and is included in
the Solaris 7 Recommended Patch Cluster.

A bug in the SunOS 4 linker will cause it to crash when linking
@option{-fPIC} compiled objects (and will therefore not allow you to build
shared libraries).

To fix this problem you can either use the most recent version of
binutils or get the latest SunOS 4 linker patch (patch ID 100170-10)
from Sun's patch site.

Sometimes on a Sun 4 you may observe a crash in the program
@command{genflags} or @command{genoutput} while building GCC.  This is said to
be due to a bug in @command{sh}.  You can probably get around it by running
@command{genflags} or @command{genoutput} manually and then retrying the
@command{make}.

On System V release 3, you may get this error message
while linking:

@smallexample
ld fatal: failed to write symbol name @var{something}
 in strings table for file @var{whatever}
@end smallexample

This probably indicates that the disk is full or your ulimit won't allow
the file to be as large as it needs to be.

This problem can also result because the kernel parameter @code{MAXUMEM}
is too small.  If so, you must regenerate the kernel and make the value
much larger.  The default value is reported to be 1024; a value of 32768
is said to work.  Smaller values may also work.

On System V, if you get an error like this,

@example
/usr/local/lib/bison.simple: In function `yyparse':
/usr/local/lib/bison.simple:625: virtual memory exhausted
@end example

@noindent
that too indicates a problem with disk space, ulimit, or @code{MAXUMEM}.

On a System V release 4 system, make sure @file{/usr/bin} precedes
@file{/usr/ucb} in @code{PATH}.  The @code{cc} command in
@file{/usr/ucb} uses libraries which have bugs.

These configurations are obsoleted in GCC 3.1.

Don't use @option{-g} when compiling with the system's compiler.  The
system's linker seems to be unable to handle such a large program with
debugging information.

The system's compiler runs out of capacity when compiling @file{stmt.c}
in GCC@.  You can work around this by building @file{cpp} in GCC
first, then use that instead of the system's preprocessor with the
system's C compiler to compile @file{stmt.c}.  Here is how:

@smallexample
mv /lib/cpp /lib/cpp.att
cp cpp /lib/cpp.gnu
echo '/lib/cpp.gnu -traditional $@{1+"$@@"@}' > /lib/cpp
chmod +x /lib/cpp
@end smallexample

The system's compiler produces bad code for some of the GCC
optimization files.  So you must build the stage 2 compiler without
optimization.  Then build a stage 3 compiler with optimization.
That executable should work.  Here are the necessary commands:

@smallexample
make LANGUAGES=c CC=stage1/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage1/ -g"
make stage2
make CC=stage2/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage2/ -g -O"
@end smallexample

You may need to raise the ULIMIT setting to build a C++ compiler,
as the file @file{cc1plus} is larger than one megabyte.

through inline assembly.

The Xtensa configuration information must be specified prior to

@heading @anchor{older}Older systems

GCC contains support files for many older (1980s and early
1990s) Unix variants.  For the most part, support for these systems
has not been deliberately removed, but it has not been maintained for
several years and may suffer from bitrot.  Support from some systems
has been removed from GCC 3: fx80, ns32-ns-genix, pyramid, tahoe,
gmicro, spur; most of these targets had not been updated since GCC
version 1.

We are planning to remove support for more older systems, starting in
GCC 3.1.  Each release will have a list of ``obsoleted'' systems.
Support for these systems is still present in that release, but
@command{configure} will fail unless the @option{--enable-obsolete}
option is given.  Unless a maintainer steps forward, support for
these systems will be removed from the next release of GCC@.

Support for older systems as targets for cross-compilation is less
problematic than support for them as hosts for GCC; if an enthusiast
wishes to make such a target work again (including resurrecting any
of the targets that never worked with GCC 2, starting from the last
CVS version before they were removed), patches
@uref{../contribute.html,,following the usual requirements}
would be likely to be accepted, since they should not affect the
support for more modern targets.

Support for old systems as hosts for GCC can cause problems if the
workarounds for compiler, library and operating system bugs affect the
cleanliness or maintainability of the rest of GCC@.  In some cases, to
bring GCC up on such a system, if still possible with current GCC, may
require first installing an old version of GCC which did work on that
system, and using it to compile a more recent GCC, to avoid bugs in
the vendor compiler.  Old releases of GCC 1 and GCC 2 are available in
the @file{old-releases} directory on the
@uref{../mirrors.html,,GCC mirror sites}.  Header bugs may generally
be avoided using @command{fixincludes}, but bugs or deficiencies in
libraries and the operating system may still cause problems.

For some systems, old versions of GNU binutils may also be useful,
and are available from @file{pub/binutils/old-releases} on
@uref{http://sources.redhat.com/mirrors.html,,sources.redhat.com mirror sites}.

Some of the information on specific systems above relates to
such older systems, but much of the information
about GCC on such systems (which may no longer be applicable to
current GCC) is to be found in the GCC texinfo manual.
