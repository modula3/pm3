# We need to use -fPIC when we are using gcc to compile the routines in

# to produce a shared library, but since we don't know ahead of time when
# we will be doing that, we just always use -fPIC when compiling the
# routines in crtstuff.c.  Likewise for libgcc2.c.   This is less painful
# than multilibbing everything with PIC and PIC-not variants.

# The pushl in CTOR initialization interferes with frame pointer elimination.
