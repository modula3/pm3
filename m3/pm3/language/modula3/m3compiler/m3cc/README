This package contains a version of gcc that's been modified to
accept Modula-3 intermediate language input.

To build the package, run "m3build".  To install the result,
run "m3ship".

To build a cross-compiling version, run "m3build -DM3CC_TARGET=xyz".
Where "xyz" is the name of the target Modula-3 platform.  The result
will be left in "abc-xyz/m3cgc1" where "abc" is your normal build
directory.  The cross compiler will not be shipped by m3ship.
If you're adding a new platform, you will need to update src/m3makefile.
