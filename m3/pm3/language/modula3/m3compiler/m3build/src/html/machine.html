<H1>Machine and operating system dependencies</H1>
<P>

<TT>m3build</TT> contains some built-in support for machine and
operating system dependencies. The package structure makes provision
for separate build directories for different machine and operating
system combinations. The default behaviour of <TT>m3build</TT> is to
generate the compiled object files, libaries and programs in the build
directory corresponding to the machine and operating system on which
<TT>m3build</TT> is executing.
<P>

The following set of variables exist to allow <TT>m3makefile</TT>s to be
parameterised by machine and operating system.

<DL>
<DT>TARGET<DD>  
          This variable defines the machine type on which the library or
          program being built will execute. It is chosen from the standard
          set of machine types on which Modula-3 runs. Check the runtime
          or m3build packages for the complete set.
<DT>OS_TYPE<DD>  
          This variable defines the operating system under which the library
          or program being built will execute. Currently, Modula-3 supports
          two operating system variants, POSIX and WIN32. The former breaks
          down further into specific variants, but this variation is not made
          available to clients. [There is a way if you absolutely need it,
          see the unix package.]
<DT>BUILD_DIR<DD>  
          This names the package sub-directory in which object files,
          libraries and programs will be built. It is usually, but not
          always, the same as <TT>TARGET</TT>.
</DL>
<P>

The net effect of the above allows a single package to build a family
of architectural variants, in different build sub-directories, where
each variant uses the same set of <TT>m3makefile</TT>s, parameterized by
the above variables. If this degree of flexibility is insufficient,
then the extra variation must be specified in a separate package,
which can use <TT>include_pkg</TT> to access the shared sources.
