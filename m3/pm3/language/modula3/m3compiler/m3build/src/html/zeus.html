<H1>Zeus animations</H1>
<P>

The following procedures support building Zeus animations.
<P>

<B> zume(X) </B>  
      run the Zeus event processor m3zume on the source file <TT>X.evt</TT>
      to produce Modula-3 sources and other resources needed to build an
      animation.  The resulting sources are included in any subsequent
      compilation.
<P>

<B> zume3D(X) </B>
      like <TT>zume</TT> but with the additional support for using
      the 3D libraries.
<P>

<B> oblume(X,O) </B>
      Like <TT>zume</TT>, runs the Zeus event processor on <TT>X.evt</TT>
      and also bundles the source file <TT>O.obl</TT> which is assumed
      to contain Obliq code.
<P>

<B> oblume3D(X,O) </B>
      like <TT>oblume</TT> but with the additional support for using
      the 3D libraries.
<P>

<B> junozume(X,V) </B>
     Runs the Zeus event processor on <TT>X.evt</TT> to produce stubs
     to connect to a Juno(1) animation server run with the <B>-zeus</B>
     option. There can be at most one Juno view per Zeus animation.
     <TT>V</TT> is the name of the view installed in the Zeus <I>Views</I>
     menu. See the Juno(1) man page for a more complete
     description of how to write a Juno animation view for
     Zeus. See the README file in the junozeus package
     for instructions on how to run an example view.
