<H1>Resources</H1>
<P>

The following procedures support the inclusion of arbitrary data,
known as a resource, in a program.
<P>

<B> resource(file) </B>  
          is shorthand for <TT>resource_named(file,file)</TT>.
<P>

<B> resource_named(rd,file) </B>  
          declares that <TT>file</TT> is a resource file.  It will be
          accessible via the reader <TT>rd</TT> if a bundle is built.
<P>

<B> bundle(m) </B>  
          declares that the module <TT>m</TT> is to be built as a bundle
          of the files specified by the prior calls to <TT>resource</TT> and
          <TT>resource_named</TT>.
<P>

For a description of how to access resources from your running
program, see the
<A HREF="../../../../../../libs/libm3/src/html/Bundle.i3">Bundle</A>
and 
<A HREF="../../../../../../graphics/gr-libs/vbtkit/src/vbtkitutils/Rsrc.i3">Rsrc</A>
interfaces.
