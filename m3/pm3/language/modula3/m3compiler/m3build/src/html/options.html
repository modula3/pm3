<H1>m3build command line options</H1>

<P>
The syntax for invoking <B>m3build</B>, within a package directory, is
<PRE>
     m3build [options] [target ...]
</PRE>
<P>
If no target is specified, <B>all</B> is assumed.  It causes the
specified program or library to be built.  The only other
target that is supported in all
<A HREF="m3makefile.html"><TT>m3makefiles</TT></A> is <B>clean</B>
which removes any derived files created by <B>m3build all</B>.
<P>

The following options are interpreted by <TT>m3build</TT>.

<DL>
<DT>-b dir<DD>
       Use the <TT>dir</TT> configuration and build in the directory
       named <TT>dir</TT>.  The default build directory is configured
       into <TT>m3build</TT> when it is installed.
<DT>-d dir<DD>
       Change the current directory to <TT>dir</TT> before doing anything.
       This option is most useful when you're editing in the <TT>src</TT>
       subdirectory and compile command you need is <TT>m3build -d ..</TT>.
<DT>-F file<DD>
       Read the quake code in <TT>file</TT> before the package 
       <TT>m3makefile</TT>.
<DT>-T dir<DD>
     Read templates from <TT>dir</TT> instead of the default location.  The new
     directory must include the full set of templates (e.g. <TT>COMMON</TT>,
     <TT>PLATFORMS</TT>, ...).
<DT>-S<DD>
       Generate derived objects regardless of the current directory's
       name.  Normally, if the current working directory is <TT>src</TT>,
       <TT>m3build</TT> will refuse to build derived objects.
<DT>-O<DD>
       Read the <TT>m3overrides</TT> file if present.
<DT>-Dname=value<DD>
       Bind the <TT>value</TT> to <TT>name</TT> before reading the
       <TT>m3makefile</TT>.
