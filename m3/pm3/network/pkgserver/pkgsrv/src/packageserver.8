packageserver - shared software management server
.SH SYNTAX
\fBpackageserver\fR [\fB-name\fR \fBreplicaName\fR] [\fB-c configFile\fR] [\fB-init\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is the server which provides the package management
services described in the manpage for \fBpackagetool(1)\fR.  You must know
what you are doing before attempting to run this program.  Please read
the \fBpackagetool(1)\fR manpage before proceeding any further.  More than
likely, you will want to use \fBsmgr(1)\fR to run this program automatically
at system startup, so please read its manpage as well.
.PP
With the \fB-c\fR option, the packageserver reads its configuration from the
indicated file.  Otherwise, it fetches the configuration from the file
\fBsiphon.config\fR in the current working directory.
.PP  
The packageserver determines from its configuration file whether it is
the lock server for the local site.  The lock server maintains a local
database which is a stable record of all known packages and package
state.  It also writes writes a user-readable "history" file which
represents a "check-out" history of all packages.
.PP
The lock server database is found in the "locks" subdirectory of the
current working dir.  If the database doesn't exist, the \fB-init\fR option
allows creation of an empty one.  The \fB-init\fR option also instructs
the packageserver, if it also a lock server, to initially manage the
set of repositories fond in its configuration file.  At startup time,
these repositories are added to the lock database.  If there are remote
sites, each locally known repository is enumerated at each foreign site.
For each new package found, a local lock database entry is created.
Each local replica then enumerates its file system and creates a lock
server entry (managed by the local site) for any package directory found.

The \fB-name\fR option is used to dictate the server name.  Otherwise the
local host name is used.

This program should be normally run as superUser so that it can change
its uid to that of the site owner.

If the configuration specifies the existence of remote sites, a
designated packageserver replica will act as a \fBsiphon\fR server.  This
siphon server is reponsible for propagating package updates for all
repositories which are shared remotely.

The goal of the siphon is to present a consistent view of a a
repository tree at all sites.  To change a package, a user checks it
out, makes modifications, and then reships it.  (See \fBpackagetool(1)\fR.)
The ship operation updates the package (essentially) instantaneously
at the local site, and also enqueues it for transmission to the other
sites.  Since it typically takes several minutes (potentially several
hours) for the transmission to make it to remote sites, there is an
interval during which different sites have different versions of the
package.  To prevent overlapping changes, the package tools use a
version number scheme: users can only check out a package if the
current site has the most recent version of that package.

There is also a package fingerprint skulker that ensures consistency
among replicas.  (See \fBpkgfp(1)\fR.)  The fingerprinter runs every night
at each site, and fingerprints every package that has changed at that
site.  The skulker then compares the fingerprints for the various
sites, and reports any inconsistencies that are found.

To check the current status of the packageserver, use \fBpkgq(1)\fR.

.SH "SIPHON CONFIGURATION FILE"
The packageserver gets its configuration information from a file.  The
contents of this file are interpreted as an S-expression which is a
list of attribute value pairs.  The list describes the site to be
considered local by the packageserver.  The following
attribute/value pairs are recognized:
.IP "" 4
\fBsite\fR "string"
.IP "" 8
The corresponding value is a string which names the site being
described.  Site names are chosen arbitrarily.  We use the convention
"S-xxx" (e.g.  S-SRC, S-PRL).  This attribute is required.
.IP "" 4
\fBlockServer\fR "replicaName"
.IP "" 8
Specifies the network name of the lock server for the site being
specified.  For the present, this must be an IP hostname recognizable
to \fBgethostbyname(3)\fR.  This attribute is required.
.IP "" 4
\fBsiphonServer\fR "replicaName"
.IP "" 8
Specifies the name of the siphon server for the site being specified.
For the present, this must be an IP address recognizable to
\fBgethostbyname(3)\fR.  This attribute can be omitted.  It is irrelevant if
there are no remote sites, otherwise it defaults to the value of the
\fBlockServer\fR attribute.
.IP "" 4
\fBreplicaServers\fR  "replicaName1"  "replicaName2" ...
.IP "" 8
Specifies a list of server names, one for each replica at this site.
This attribute can be omitted.  It defaults to a single element list
consisting of the value of the lock server attribute.  If this
attribute exists, the lock server name must be included as an value
element.
.IP "" 4
\fBipPort\fR "stringPortNumber"
.IP "" 8
Determines the IP port to which the packagetools will target new
requests.  The default Network Object daemon (\fBnetobjd(1)\fR) serve this
purpose instead if no \fBipPort\fR is specified.
.IP "" 4
\fBremoteSites\fR  site-exprA site-exprB  ...
.IP "" 8
Each value element of this attribute is in itself an attribute-value
list representing a remote site.  Within these lists, the following
attribute types are recognized: \fBsite\fR, \fBsiphonServe\fRr,
\fBipPort\fR, and \fBroute\fR.  The first three have the same
semantics as in a top level site description.  The "route" attribute
is optional and is interpreted as follows:
.IP "" 12
\fBroute\fR "siteName1" "siteName2" ...
.IP "" 8
Updates should not be sent directly to the site being described,
rather they should be routed through one of the sites in the route
list.  This list is ordered by route preference. The first element is
the best candidate.
.IP "" 8
The \fBremoteSites\fR attribute is optional.
.IP "" 4
\fBrepositories\fR "repositorySpec1" "repositorySpec2" ...
.IP "" 8
This attribute specifies the repositories known to the local replica.
Each repositorySpec is a list with three elements: a repository name;
a file system directory to which the repository maps; and an optional
list of file system directories which may be used to hold packages.
For example:
.EX
    (repositories
       ("cra" "/proj/cra/pkg"
          ("/proj/disks/d0/cra"
           "/proj/disks/d2/cra"
           "/proj/disks/d3/cra")))
.EE
This indicates single repository "cra" whose file system directory is
"/proj/cra/pkg".  Three different directories in "/proj/disks" are
cited as locations for new packages.

The final list argument in a repositorySpec is intended to allow
repositories to be split accross multiple volumes.  At package
creation time, the server determines which of the listed directories
contatins the greatest amount of free disk space.  The new package is
created there, and a symbolic link to the new package is created in
the actual repository directory (/proj/m3/pkg) if necessary.
.IP "" 4
\fBexports\fR "exportSpec1" "exportSpec2" ...
.IP "" 8
This attribute specifies the set of export paths known to the local
replica.  Each \fBexportSpec\fR is itself a list with two elements: an
export path and a file system directory to which the export path
corresponds.  For example:
.IP "" 12
(exports ("mips" "/proj/mips"))
.IP "" 8
This indicates a single export path knwon as "mips" which maps to the
local directory name "/proj/mips".
.IP "" 4
\fBdefaultRepository\fR "repositoryName"
.IP "" 8
This attribute specifies the repository name to be used as the default
by the \fBpackagetool(1)\fR when presented with a package name which is a
relative path name.  This attribute is not required.  If it is not
present, relative package names are disallowed by the packagetool.
.IP "" 4
\fBbackupServers\fR "replicaName1"  "replicaName2" ...
.IP "" 8
List of package server names. Packages shipped with
the \fB-b\fR option ("shippackage -b") will be backed up on the
indicated servers.  This attribute is not required.

For example, consider the SRC configuration file:
.EX
    (
        (site "S-SRC")
        (lockServer "swindle.pa.dec.com")
        (replicaServers "swindle.pa.dec.com" "bamboozle.pa.dec.com")
        (owner "firefly")
        (backupServers "swindle.pa.dec.com")
        (defaultRepository "cra")
        (ipPort "5555")
        (repositories
            ("cra" "/proj/cra/pkg"
                ("/proj/disks/d0/cra" "/proj/disks/d2/cra"
                                      "/proj/disks/d3/cra"))
            ("m3" "/proj/m3/pkg"
                ("/proj/disks/d0/m3" "/proj/disks/d1/m3"
                 "/proj/disks/d2/m3" "/proj/disks/d3/m3"))
            ("adm" "/proj/adm/pkg" ("/proj/disks/d2/adm"))
            ("src" "/proj/src/pkg" ("/proj/disks/d2/src"))
        )
        (exports
            ("mips" "/proj/mips")
            ("man" "/proj/man")
            ("doc" "/proj/doc")
            ("LINUX" "/proj/LINUX")
            ("m3" "/proj/m3")
            ("local" "/proj/local")
            ("ultrix" "/proj/ultrix")
            ("vax" "/proj/vax")
            ("alpha" "/proj/alpha")
            ("generic" "/proj/generic")
            ("sun3" "/proj/sun3")
        )
        (remoteSites 
            (
                (site "S-PRL")
                (siphonServer "mother.prl.dec.com")
                (ipPort "5555")
            ))))
.EE
This specifies that the local site is name "S-SRC", with a lock server
and siphon server at the host "swindle.pa.dec.com".  There is a
secondary packageserver replica at "bamboozle.pa.dec.com".  All
repositories are file system directories owned by the user "firefly".
This replica knows about repositories "cra", "m3", "adm", and "src",
and export paths "mips", "man", "doc", "LINUX", "m3", "local",
"ultrix", vax", "alpha", "generic", and "sun3".  Backups will be kept
(if requested) at the server on swindle.  The default repository for
all new packages is "cra".  This server listens on TCP port 5555.
There is one remote site, S-PRL, whose siphon server can be found at
"mother.prl.dec.com" listening on IP port 5555.
.SH "EXPORT DIRECTORY MANAGEMENT"
As described in the \fBpackagetool(1)\fR manpage, the package server
allows for the "export" of symbolic links to directories outside of
the repository file space.  These links point back to the repository
and make it possible to implement search paths containing related
files from unrelated packages.  This is useful, for example, when
publishing executable or manpages for public use.
.PP
The packageserver allows for automatic creation of export directories
under certain conditions:

    1)  A parent of the export path exists in the "exports" map
        (see the previous section).

    2)  The packageserver has the necessary access control rights to
        create the child directory.
            
It is possible to export a link to a path which is not present at one
or more local replicas.  Links will be exported at all replicas
supporting the path nonetheless.
.SH "LOCAL CONFIGURATION"
The standard SRC site is called "S-SRC".  The lock server is 
swindle.  The lock database and history file can be found in the 
directory /swindle/usr/adm/servers/ps/locks.
