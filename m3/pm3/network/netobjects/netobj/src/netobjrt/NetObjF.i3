(* The netobj package uses specific subclasses of Pickle.Reader and
   Pickle.Writer to pickle object parameters.  If you need to handle
   netobj pickling differently than other kinds of pickling, you can
   use these routines to check if the pickle is being used as a
   network object parameter or return value. *)

(* We want to be able to pass an identifier for a network object
   between machines outside of the network object system.  "ToWireRep"
   converts a "NetObj.T" into a wire representation and a text string
   describing the location of the object.  "FromWireRep" converts a
   wire representation and location back into a "NetObj.T".  If the
   corresponding network object (or a surrogate) does not already
   exist in the process, "FromWireRep" will raise "NetObj.Error" if it
   cannot be retreived from "loc". *)
