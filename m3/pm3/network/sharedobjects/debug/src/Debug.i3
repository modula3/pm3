(* This interface provides an object for maintaining a trace of
   program flow and controlling the amount of debug printing done at
   run-time.  

   By surrounding each section of code by an appropriate "push()" and
   "pop()" call, at any time the stack of tags can be retrieved and
   printed or used as an exception argument, for example.

   Furthermore, the parameter "p" is used to control the printing of
   tags and other debugging output during run time.  If a tag is
   "push()"ed with a lower "p" than the "Debug.T" object was
   initialized with, it is printed immediately.  Similarly, a call to
   "print()" only results in output if its "p" argument is less than
   the value of the "Debug.T" object.
