[Comment from Paul Vixie:
Use the BSD copyright.  I modified it for the Internet Software Consortium's
use when I had to tack on a new copyright on the BIND source files; it reads
as follows; be sure to put your name or your company's name in the appropriate
places.  The goal of this copyright is to assert ownership for the sole purpose
of disclaiming liability.  Every "must" whether express or implied has that as
its only goal.]
