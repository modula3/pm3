Thanks for your note.  We are in no way opposed to public domain
scientific/mathematical software -- in fact we make SLATEC
coonveniently available through our Web pages (and may include it on
our forthcoming CDROM).  Since your project will now not use NR, we
certainly wish you well.  (You might want to consider SLATEC as your
source of routines and algorithms.  The FORTRAN is incredibly backward
and ugly, but the algorithms themselves are pretty good.  It is a
finite collection of about 1400 routines.)

I think it is a pity that the Pascal/Modula 2/Modula 3 line has not
attracted more scientific users than it has, but we long ago decided
to be language agnostics rather than language missionaries: we
implement in languages with the greatest number of users, whether or
not they are ideal.

Cheers,
Bill Press
