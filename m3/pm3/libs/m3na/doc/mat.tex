\section{xMat: Matrices}
The matrix computations are implemented naively.  Consider
Krey88 to be the source, though any number of texts would
serve.  Notably, Gems90 takes the naive approach for vectors
and matrices of 3 and 4 dimensions.

Further testing may show that large matrixes need more
careful treatment of truncation.
