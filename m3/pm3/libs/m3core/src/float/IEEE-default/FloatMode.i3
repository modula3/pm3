(* Change the rounding mode for the calling thread to "md", or raise
   the exception if this cannot be done.  This affects the implicit

   of the first five flags is defined precisely in the IEEE floating

\begin{quote}   
   "Invalid" = invalid argument to an operation.  

   "Inexact" = an operation produced an inexact result.

   "Overflow" = a floating-point operation produced a result whose
   absolute value is too large to be represented.

   "Underflow" = a floating-point operation produced a result whose
   absolute value is too small to be represented.

   "DivByZero" = floating-point division by zero.

   The meaning of the last two flags is:

   "IntOverflow" = an integer operation produced a result whose
   absolute value is too large to be represented.

   "IntDivByZero" = integer "DIV" or "MOD" by zero.

   is either:

   "Ignore" = return some result and do nothing.

   "SetFlag" = return some result and set the condition flag.  For
   IEEE implementations, the result of the operation is defined by the
   standard.
        
   "Trap" = possibly set the condition flag; in any case raise the
   "Trap" exception with the appropriate flag as the argument.
