     boundaries.  The garbage collector scans thread stacks, but only
     looks at these possible pointer locations.  Setting this value
     smaller than is needed will only make your system run slower.
     Setting it too large will cause the collector to collect storage
     that is not free. *)

CONST
  StackFrameAlignment = 16;
  (* Stack frames must be aligned to this constraint (in ADRSIZE units). 
     It's not a big deal if this value is too large, but it may break 
     the thread mechanism to make it too small. *)
