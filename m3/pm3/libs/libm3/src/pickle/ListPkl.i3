(* If a program contains an import of this interface, a "Pickle.Special"
   with "sp.sc = TYPECODE (List.T)" will be passed to
   "Pickle.RegisterSpecial" during initialization.  This special pickles
   references "r" with "TYPECODE (r) = TYPECODE (List.T)" iteratively rather
   than recursively, and is thus useful for long lists in small stacks. *)
