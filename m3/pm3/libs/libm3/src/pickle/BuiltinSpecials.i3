(*
Some common Modula-3 types require special handling during
pickling.  This module provides that handling for the
following types:  TextLiteral.T, Atom.T, and RefList.T.

Values of type "TextLiteral.T" contain an overly large array of
characters.  But, these values are generated by the compiler and are
not heap allocated.  The pickle specials take care of the bogus array.
Note that subtypes of these types are pickled by the default pickle
writers.

Values of type "Atom.T" with any given name are expected to be unique
within the process.  The pickle specials make sure that this
property is maintained.

Values of type "RefList.T" (and any other type derived from "List.ig")
may contain long chains of nodes which cause the recursive pickler
to overflow its stack.  The pickle specials iterate over the list
without recursing on the stack.  Note that subtypes of "RefList.T"
are handled by the default pickle writers.
