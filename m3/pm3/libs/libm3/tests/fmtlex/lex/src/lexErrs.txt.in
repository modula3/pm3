# The examples in this file should all produce lexical errors. Most of the
# examples were created by examing the "Lex.m3" source file and picking inputs
# to test each error case.

# scan (matches non-blanks)
# There is no way for Lex.Scan to fail; it doesn't raise Lex.Error.

# match

m abcde abc	# => ""

# booleans
b tru		# => ""
b truXYZ	# => "XYZ"

# signed base-10 integers
