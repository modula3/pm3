# For each '.in' file, we produce a '.out' file. A '.out' file is out-of-date
# if it was modified less recently than its corresponding '.in' file.
#
# "make update" updates any '.out' files that are out of date
#    Use this if any of the '.in' files have changed. In this case, the
#    resulting '.out' file should be checked by hand to ensure that the test
#    program is producing the correct output.
#
# "make results" builds all the '.out' files anew
#    Use this if the test program or the Lex implementation has changed.
#
# "make [all]" runs all tests, first updating any out-of-date result files
#    This runs the test program on each '.in' file, storing the result in a
#    temporary file. The temporary file is then compared to the corresponding
#    (known good) '.out' file, and any discrepancies are reported.
