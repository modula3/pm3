(* The "GlobTree" interface allows one to construct arbitrarily complex
   boolean expressions for evaluating whether to accept or reject a
   filename. *)

(* A "GlobTree.T" represents a boolean expression for filtering
   filenames.  Its "test" method may be called with a filename to be
   tested.  It returns "TRUE" or "FALSE" according to whether the name
   is accepted or rejected by the expression.

   Expressions are trees constructed from nodes representing either
   primitive matching operations (primaries) or operators that are
   applied to their subexpressions.  The simplest primitives are
   "False", which matches nothing, and "True", which matches everything.

   A more useful primitive is the matching operation.  It is
   constructed with a glob-style pattern.  Its "test" method returns
   an indication of whether the given filename matches the pattern.

   Expressions can be combined with the boolean operators AND, OR, and
   NOT, to form more complex expressions. *)

PROCEDURE Match(pattern: TEXT; options := Glob.MatchOptions{}): T;
(* Return a "match" primitive for the given pattern.  Matching is
   performed by "Glob.Match", using the specified options. *)

PROCEDURE And(left, right: T): T;
(* Return an AND expression. *)

PROCEDURE Or(left, right: T): T;
(* Return an OR expression. *)

PROCEDURE Not(child: T): T;
(* Return an expression that evaluates the logical negation of its
   subexpression. *)

END GlobTree.
