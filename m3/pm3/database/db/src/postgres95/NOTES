The following fields are not defined in the Postgres implementation of DB.

    scale     : INTEGER;  (* number of digits right of the decimal place *)
    nullable  : Nullable;


We don't use binary cursors for the values. This is probably slow, but
should work as a start.

There is still some cleaning up to do about the memory allocations. In
fact, this should be done at the same time as using binary cursors.
