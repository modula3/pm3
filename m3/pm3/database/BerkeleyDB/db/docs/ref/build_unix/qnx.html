<h1 align=center>QNX</h1>
<p><ol>
<p><li><b>To what versions of QNX has DB been ported?</b>
<p>Berkeley DB has been ported to the QNX Neutrino technology which is commonly
referred to as QNX RTP (Real-Time Platform).  Berkeley DB has not been
ported to earlier versions of QNX, such as QNX 4.25.
<p><li><b>Are there any QNX filesystem issues?</b>
<p>Berkeley DB generates temporary files for use in transactionally
protected file system operations.  Due to the filename length limit of
48 characters in the QNX filesystem, applications that are using
transactions should specify a database name that is at most 43 characters.
<p><li><b>What is the impact of QNX's use of <b>shm_open</b>(2) for
shared memory regions?</b>
<p>QNX requires the use of the POSIX <b>shm_open</b>(2) and
<b>shm_unlink</b>(2) calls for shared memory regions that will later
be mapped into memory using <b>mmap</b>(2).  QNX's implementation
of the shared memory functions requires that the name given must begin
with a slash, and that no other slash may appear in the name.
<p>In order to comply with those requirements and allow relative pathnames
to find the same environment, Berkeley DB uses only the last component of the
home directory path and the name of the shared memory file, separated
by a colon, as the name specified to the shared memory functions.  For
example, if an application specifies a home directory of
<b>/home/db/DB_DIR</b>, Berkeley DB will use <b>/DB_DIR:__db.001</b> as
the name for the shared memory area argument to <b>shm_open</b>(2).
<p>The impact of this decision is that the last component of all
environment home directory pathnames on QNX must be unique with respect
to each other.  Additionally, Berkeley DB requires that environments use home
directories for QNX in order to generate a reasonable entry in the
shared memory area.
<p><li><b>What are the implications of QNX's requirement to use
<b>shm_open</b>(2) in order to use <b>mmap</b>(2)?</b>
<p>QNX requires that files mapped with <b>mmap</b>(2) be opened using
<b>shm_open</b>(2).  There are other places in addition to the
environment shared memory regions, where Berkeley DB tries to memory map files
if it can.
<p>The memory pool subsystem normally attempts to use <b>mmap</b>(2)
even when using private memory, as indicated by the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a>
flag to <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a>.  In the case of QNX, if an application is
using private memory, Berkeley DB will not attempt to map the memory and will
instead use the local cache.
<p><li><b>What are the implications of QNX's mutex implementation using
microkernel resources?</b>
<p>On QNX, the primitives implementing mutexes consume system resources.
Therefore, if an application unexpectedly fails, those resources could
leak.  Berkeley DB solves this problem by always allocating mutexes in the
persistent shared memory regions.  Then, if an application fails,
running recovery or explicitly removing the database environment by
calling the <a href="../../api_c/env_remove.html">DB_ENV-&gt;remove</a> method will allow Berkeley DB to release those
previously held mutex resources.  If an application specifies the
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a> flag (choosing not to use persistent shared memory),
and then fails, mutexes allocated in that private memory may leak their
underlying system resources.  Therefore, the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a> flag
should be used with caution on QNX.
