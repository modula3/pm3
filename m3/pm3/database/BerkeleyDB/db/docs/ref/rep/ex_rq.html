<h1 align=center>Ex_repquote: putting it all together</h1>
<p>A replicated application must initialize a replicated environment, set
up its communication infrastructure, and then make sure that incoming
messages are received and processed.
<p>To initialize replication, ex_repquote creates a Berkeley DB environment and
calls <a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_rep_transport</a> to establish a send function.  The following
code fragment (from the env_init function, found in
<b>ex_repquote/ex_rq_main.c</b>) demonstrates this.  Prior to calling
this function, the application has called machtab_init to initialize
its environment ID to port mapping structure and passed this structure
into env_init.
<pre><p><blockquote>if ((ret = db_env_create(&dbenv, 0)) != 0) {
	fprintf(stderr, "%s: env create failed: %s\n",
	    progname, db_strerror(ret));
	return (ret);
}
dbenv-&gt;set_errfile(dbenv, stderr);
dbenv-&gt;set_errpfx(dbenv, prefix);
(void)dbenv-&gt;set_cachesize(dbenv, 0, CACHESIZE, 0);
<p>
dbenv-&gt;app_private = machtab;
(void)dbenv-&gt;set_rep_transport(dbenv, SELF_EID, quote_send);
<p>
flags = DB_CREATE | DB_THREAD |
    DB_INIT_LOCK | DB_INIT_LOG | DB_INIT_MPOOL | DB_INIT_TXN;
<p>
ret = dbenv-&gt;open(dbenv, home, flags, 0);</blockquote></pre>
<p>ex_repquote opens a listening socket for incoming connections and opens
an outgoing connection to every machine that it knows about (that is,
all the sites listed in the <b>-o</b> command line argument).
Applications can structure the details of this in different ways, but
ex_repquote creates a user-level thread to listen on its socket, plus
a thread to loop and handle messages on each socket, in addition to the
threads needed to manage the user interface, update the database on the
master, and read from the database on the client (in other words, in
addition to the normal functionality of any database application).
<p>Once the initial threads have all been started and the communications
infrastructure is initialized, the application signals that it is ready
for replication and joins a replication group by calling
<a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a>:
<pre><p><blockquote>if (whoami == MASTER) {
	if ((ret = dbenv-&gt;rep_start(dbenv, NULL, DB_REP_MASTER)) != 0) {
		/* Complain and exit on error. */
	}
	/* Go run the master application code. */
} else {
	memset(&local, 0, sizeof(local));
	local.data = myaddr;
	local.size = strlen(myaddr) + 1;
	if ((ret =
	    dbenv-&gt;rep_start(dbenv, &local, DB_REP_CLIENT)) != 0) {
		/* Complain and exit on error. */
	}
	/* Sleep to give ourselves a minute to find a master. */
	sleep(5);
	/* Go run the client application code. */
}</blockquote></pre>
<p>Note the use of the optional second argument to <a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a> in
the client initialization code.  The argument "myaddr" is a piece of
data, opaque to Berkeley DB, that will be broadcast to each member of a
replication group; it allows new clients to join a replication group,
without knowing the location of all its members;  the new client will
be contacted by the members it does not know about, who will receive
the new client's contact information that was specified in "myaddr."
See <a href="../../ref/rep/newsite.html">Connecting to a new site</a> for more
information.
<p>The final piece of a replicated application is the code that loops,
receives, and processes messages from a given remote environment.
ex_repquote runs one of these loops in a parallel thread for each socket
connection; other applications may want to queue messages somehow and
process them asynchronously, or select() on a number of sockets and
either look up the correct environment ID for each or encapsulate the
ID in the communications protocol.  The details may thus vary from
application to application, but in ex_repquote the message-handling loop
is as follows (code fragment from the hm_loop function, found in
<b>ex_repquote/ex_rq_util.c</b>):
<pre><p><blockquote>DB_ENV *dbenv;
DBT rec, control;	/* Structures encapsulating a received message. */

repsite_t self;		/* My host and port identification. */
int eid;		/* Environment from whom I am receiving messages. */
int fd;			/* FD on which I am receiving messages. */
int master_eid;		/* Global indicating the current master eid. */
int n;			/* Number of sites; obtained from machtab_parm. */
