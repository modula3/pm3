<h1 align=center>Reviewing Berkeley DB log files</h1>
<p>If you are running with transactions and logging, the <a href="../../utility/db_printlog.html">db_printlog</a>
utility can be a useful debugging aid.  The <a href="../../utility/db_printlog.html">db_printlog</a> utility
will display the contents of your log files in a human readable (and
machine-processable) format.
<p>The <a href="../../utility/db_printlog.html">db_printlog</a> utility will attempt to display any and all
log files present in a designated db_home directory.  For each log record,
<a href="../../utility/db_printlog.html">db_printlog</a> will display a line of the form:
<p><blockquote><pre>[22][28]db_big: rec: 43 txnid 80000963 prevlsn [21][10483281]</pre></blockquote>
<p>The opening numbers in square brackets are the <i>log sequence
number</i> (<i>LSN</i>) of the log record being displayed.  The first
number indicates the log file in which the record appears, and the
second number indicates the offset in that file of the record.
<p>The first character string identifies the particular log operation being
reported.  The log records corresponding to particular operations are
described following.  The rest of the line consists of name/value pairs.
<p>The rec field indicates the record type (this is used to dispatch records
in the log to appropriate recovery functions).
<p>The txnid field identifies the transaction for which this record was
written.  A txnid of 0 means that the record was written outside the
context of any transaction.  You will see these most frequently for
checkpoints.
<p>Finally, the prevlsn contains the LSN of the last record for this
transaction.  By following prevlsn fields, you can accumulate all the
updates for a particular transaction.  During normal abort processing,
this field is used to quickly access all the records for a particular
transaction.
<p>After the initial line identifying the record type, each field of the log
record is displayed, one item per line.  There are several fields that
appear in many different records and a few fields that appear only in
some records.
<p>The following table presents each currently written log record type with
a brief description of the operation it describes.

<h3>Augmenting the Log for Debugging</h3>
<p>When debugging applications, it is sometimes useful to log not only the
actual operations that modify pages, but also the underlying Berkeley DB
functions being executed.  This form of logging can add significant bulk
to your log, but can permit debugging application errors that are almost
impossible to find any other way.  To turn on these log messages, specify
the --enable-debug_rop and --enable-debug_wop configuration options when
configuring Berkeley DB.  See <a href="../../ref/build_unix/conf.html">Configuring
Berkeley DB</a> for more information.
<h3>Extracting Committed Transactions and Transaction Status</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it is helpful to use the human-readable log output to
determine which transactions committed and aborted.  The awk script,
commit.awk, (found in the db_printlog directory of the Berkeley DB
distribution) allows you to do just that.  The following command,
where log_output is the output of db_printlog, will display a list of
the transaction IDs of all committed transactions found in the log:
<p><blockquote><pre>awk -f commit.awk log_output</pre></blockquote>
<p>If you need a complete list of both committed and aborted transactions,
then the script status.awk will produce it.  The syntax is as follows:
<p><blockquote><pre>awk -f status.awk log_output</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Extracting Transaction Histories</h3>
<p>Another useful debugging aid is to print out the complete history of a
transaction.  The awk script txn.awk allows you to do that.  The
following command line, where log_output is the output of
<a href="../../utility/db_printlog.html">db_printlog</a> and txnlist is a comma-separated list of transaction
IDs, will display all log records associated with the designated
transaction ids:
<p><blockquote><pre>awk -f txn.awk TXN=txnlist log_output</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Extracting File Histories</h3>
<p>The awk script fileid.awk allows you to extract all log records that
refer to a designated file.  The syntax for the fileid.awk script is
the following, where log_output is the output of db_printlog and fids
is a comma-separated list of fileids:
<p><blockquote><pre>awk -f fileid.awk PGNO=fids log_output</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Extracting Page Histories</h3>
<p>The awk script pgno.awk allows you to extract all log records that refer
to designated page numbers.  However, because this script will extract
records with the designated page numbers for all files, it is most
useful in conjunction with the fileid script.  The syntax for the
pgno.awk script is the following, where log_output is the output of
db_printlog and pgnolist is a comma-separated list of page numbers:
<p><blockquote><pre>awk -f pgno.awk PGNO=pgnolist log_output</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Other log processing tools</h3>
<p>The awk script count.awk prints out the number of log records
encountered that belonged to some transaction (that is, the number of
log records excluding those for checkpoints and
non-transaction-protected operations).
<p>The script range.awk will extract a subset of a log.  This is useful
when the output of <a href="../../utility/db_printlog.html">db_printlog</a> is too large to be reasonably
manipulated with an editor or other tool.  The syntax for range.awk is
the following, where <b>sf</b> and <b>so</b> represent the LSN
of the beginning of the sublog you want to extract, and <b>ef</b> and
<b>eo</b> represent the LSN of the end of the sublog you want to
extract:
<p><blockquote><pre>awk -f range.awk START_FILE=sf START_OFFSET=so END_FILE=ef END_OFFSET=eo log_output</pre></blockquote>
