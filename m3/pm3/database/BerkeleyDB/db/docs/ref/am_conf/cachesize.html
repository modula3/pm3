<h1 align=center>Selecting a cache size</h1>
<p>The size of the cache used for the underlying database can be specified
by calling the <a href="../../api_c/db_set_cachesize.html">DB-&gt;set_cachesize</a> method.
Choosing a cache size is, unfortunately, an art.  Your cache must be at
least large enough for your working set plus some overlap for unexpected
situations.
<p>When using the Btree access method, you must have a cache big enough for
the minimum working set for a single access.  This will include a root
page, one or more internal pages (depending on the depth of your tree),
and a leaf page.  If your cache is any smaller than that, each new page
will force out the least-recently-used page, and Berkeley DB will re-read the
root page of the tree anew on each database request.
<p>If your keys are of moderate size (a few tens of bytes) and your pages
are on the order of 4K to 8K, most Btree applications will be only
three levels.  For example, using 20 byte keys with 20 bytes of data
associated with each key, a 8KB page can hold roughly 400 keys (or 200
key/data pairs), so a fully populated three-level Btree will hold 32
million key/data pairs, and a tree with only a 50% page-fill factor will
still hold 16 million key/data pairs.  We rarely expect trees to exceed
five levels, although Berkeley DB will support trees up to 255 levels.
<p>The rule-of-thumb is that cache is good, and more cache is better.
Generally, applications benefit from increasing the cache size up to a
point, at which the performance will stop improving as the cache size
increases.  When this point is reached, one of two things have happened:
either the cache is large enough that the application is almost never
having to retrieve information from disk, or, your application is doing
truly random accesses, and therefore increasing size of the cache doesn't
significantly increase the odds of finding the next requested information
in the cache.  The latter is fairly rare -- almost all applications show
some form of locality of reference.
<p>That said, it is important not to increase your cache size beyond the
capabilities of your system, as that will result in reduced performance.
Under many operating systems, tying down enough virtual memory will cause
your memory and potentially your program to be swapped.  This is
especially likely on systems without unified OS buffer caches and virtual
memory spaces, as the buffer cache was allocated at boot time and so
cannot be adjusted based on application requests for large amounts of
virtual memory.
<p>For example, even if accesses are truly random within a Btree, your
access pattern will favor internal pages to leaf pages, so your cache
should be large enough to hold all internal pages.  In the steady state,
this requires at most one I/O per operation to retrieve the appropriate
leaf page.
<p>You can use the <a href="../../utility/db_stat.html">db_stat</a> utility to monitor the effectiveness of
your cache.  The following output is excerpted from the output of that
utility's <b>-m</b> option:
<p><blockquote><pre>prompt: db_stat -m
131072  Cache size (128K).
4273    Requested pages found in the cache (97%).
134     Requested pages not found in the cache.
18      Pages created in the cache.
116     Pages read into the cache.
93      Pages written from the cache to the backing file.
5       Clean pages forced from the cache.
13      Dirty pages forced from the cache.
0       Dirty buffers written by trickle-sync thread.
130     Current clean buffer count.
4       Current dirty buffer count.
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The statistics for this cache say that there have been 4,273 requests of
the cache, and only 116 of those requests required an I/O from disk.  This
means that the cache is working well, yielding a 97% cache hit rate.  The
<a href="../../utility/db_stat.html">db_stat</a> utility will present these statistics both for the cache
as a whole and for each file within the cache separately.
