<h1 align=center>Minimum keys per page</h1>
<p>The number of keys stored on each page affects the size of a Btree and
how it is maintained.  Therefore, it also affects the retrieval and search
performance of the tree.  For each Btree, Berkeley DB computes a maximum key
and data size.  This size is a function of the page size and the fact that
at least two key/data pairs must fit on any Btree page.  Whenever key or
data items exceed the calculated size, they are stored on overflow pages
instead of in the standard Btree leaf pages.
<p>Applications may use the <a href="../../api_c/db_set_bt_minkey.html">DB-&gt;set_bt_minkey</a> method to change the minimum
number of keys that must fit on a Btree page from two to another value.
Altering this value in turn alters the on-page maximum size, and can be
used to force key and data items which would normally be stored in the
Btree leaf pages onto overflow pages.
<p>Some data sets can benefit from this tuning.  For example, consider an
application using large page sizes, with a data set almost entirely
consisting of small key and data items, but with a few large items.  By
setting the minimum number of keys that must fit on a page, the
application can force the outsized items to be stored on overflow pages.
That in turn can potentially keep the tree more compact, that is, with
fewer internal levels to traverse during searches.
<p>The following calculation is similar to the one performed by the Btree
implementation.  (The <b>minimum_keys</b> value is multiplied by 2
because each key/data pair requires 2 slots on a Btree page.)
<p><blockquote><pre>maximum_size = page_size / (minimum_keys * 2)</pre></blockquote>
<p>Using this calculation, if the page size is 8KB and the default
<b>minimum_keys</b> value of 2 is used, then any key or data items
larger than 2KB will be forced to an overflow page.  If an application
were to specify a <b>minimum_key</b> value of 100, then any key or data
items larger than roughly 40 bytes would be forced to overflow pages.
<p>It is important to remember that accesses to overflow pages do not perform
as well as accesses to the standard Btree leaf pages, and so setting the
value incorrectly can result in overusing overflow pages and decreasing
the application's overall performance.
