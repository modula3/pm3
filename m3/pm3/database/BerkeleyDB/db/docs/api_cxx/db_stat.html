<h3><pre>
#include &lt;db_cxx.h&gt;
<p>
int
Db::stat(void *sp, u_int32_t flags);
</pre></h3>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The Db::stat method creates a statistical structure and
copies a pointer to it into user-specified memory locations.
Specifically, if <b>sp</b> is non-NULL, a pointer to the statistics
for the database are copied into the memory location to which it refers.
<p>Statistical structures are created in allocated memory.  If application-specific allocation
routines have been declared (see <a href="../api_cxx/env_set_alloc.html">DbEnv::set_alloc</a> for more
information), they are used to allocate the memory; otherwise, the
library <b>malloc</b>(3) interface is used.  The caller is
responsible for deallocating the memory.  To deallocate the memory, free
the memory reference; references inside the returned memory need not be
individually freed.
<p>The <b>flags</b> value must be set to 0 or
one of the following values:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="DB_FAST_STAT">DB_FAST_STAT</a><dd>Return only the values which do not require traversal of the database.
Fields returned when this flag is set are noted with an asterisk (*)
below.
<p>Among other things, this flag makes it possible for applications to
request key and record counts without incurring the performance penalty
of traversing the entire database.  If the underlying database is of
type Recno, or of type Btree and the database was created with the
<a href="../api_cxx/db_set_flags.html#DB_RECNUM">DB_RECNUM</a> flag, the count of keys will be exact.  Otherwise,
the count of keys will be the value saved the last time the database
was traversed, or 0 if no count of keys has ever been made.  If the
underlying database is of type Recno, the count of data items will be
exact, otherwise, the count of data items will be the value saved the
last time the database was traversed, or 0 if no count of data items
has ever been done.
</dl>
<p>If the DB_FAST_STAT flag has not been specified, the
Db::stat method will access some of or all the pages in the database,
incurring a severe performance penalty as well as possibly flushing the
underlying buffer pool.
<p>In the presence of multiple threads or processes accessing an active
database, the information returned by Db::stat may be out-of-date.
<p>If the database was not opened read-only and the DB_FAST_STAT
flag was not specified, the cached key and record numbers will be
updated after the statistical information has been gathered.
<p>The Db::stat method cannot be transaction-protected.  For this reason,
it should be called in a thread of control that has no open cursors or
active transactions.
<p>The Db::stat method either returns a non-zero error value or throws an exception that
encapsulates a non-zero error value on failure, and returns 0 on success.
<h3>Hash Statistics</h3>
<p>In the case of a Hash database,
the statistics are stored in a structure of type DB_HASH_STAT.  The
following fields will be filled in:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>u_int32_t hash_magic*<dd>Magic number that identifies the file as a Hash file.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_version*<dd>The version of the Hash database.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_nkeys*<dd>The number of unique keys in the database.  If DB_FAST_STAT was
specified the count will be the last saved value unless it has never
been calculated, in which case it will be 0.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_ndata*<dd>The number of key/data pairs in the database.  If DB_FAST_STAT
was specified the count will be the last saved value unless it has never
been calculated, in which case it will be 0.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_pagesize*<dd>The underlying Hash database page (and bucket) size, in bytes.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_ffactor*<dd>The desired fill factor (number of items per bucket) specified at
database-creation time.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_buckets*<dd>The number of hash buckets.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_free<dd>The number of pages on the free list.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_bfree<dd>The number of bytes free on bucket pages.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_bigpages<dd>The number of big key/data pages.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_big_bfree<dd>The number of bytes free on big item pages.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_overflows<dd>The number of overflow pages (overflow pages are pages that contain items
that did not fit in the main bucket page).
<dt>u_int32_t hash_ovfl_free<dd>The number of bytes free on overflow pages.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_dup<dd>The number of duplicate pages.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_dup_free<dd>The number of bytes free on duplicate pages.
</dl>
<h3>Btree and Recno Statistics</h3>
<p>In the case of a Btree or Recno database,
the statistics are stored in a structure of type DB_BTREE_STAT.  The
following fields will be filled in:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>u_int32_t bt_magic*<dd>Magic number that identifies the file as a Btree database.
<dt>u_int32_t bt_version*<dd>The version of the Btree database.
<dt>u_int32_t bt_nkeys*<dd>For the Btree Access Method, the number of unique keys in the database.
If DB_FAST_STAT was specified and the database was created with
the <a href="../api_cxx/db_set_flags.html#DB_RECNUM">DB_RECNUM</a> flag, the count will be exact, otherwise, the
count will be the last saved value unless it has never been calculated,
in which case it will be 0.
<p>For the Recno Access Method, the exact number of records in the
database.
<dt>u_int32_t bt_ndata*<dd>For the Btree Access Method, the number of key/data pairs in the
database.  If DB_FAST_STAT was specified the count will be the
last saved value unless it has never been calculated, in which case it
will be 0.
<p>For the Recno Access Method, the exact number of records in the
database. If the database has been configured to not renumber records
during deletion, the count of records will only reflect undeleted
records.
<dt>u_int32_t bt_pagesize*<dd>Underlying database page size, in bytes.
<dt>u_int32_t bt_minkey*<dd>The minimum keys per page.
<dt>u_int32_t bt_re_len*<dd>The length of fixed-length records.
<dt>u_int32_t bt_re_pad*<dd>The padding byte value for fixed-length records.

<dt>u_int32_t bt_over_pgfree<dd>Number of bytes free in database overflow pages.
</dl>
<h3>Queue Statistics</h3>
<p>In the case of a Queue database,
the statistics are stored in a structure of type DB_QUEUE_STAT.  The
following fields will be filled in:

<dt>u_int32_t qs_version*<dd>The version of the Queue file type.
<dt>u_int32_t qs_nkeys*<dd>The number of records in the database.  If DB_FAST_STAT was
specified the count will be the last saved value unless it has never
been calculated, in which case it will be 0.
<dt>u_int32_t qs_ndata*<dd>The number of records in the database.  If DB_FAST_STAT was
specified the count will be the last saved value unless it has never
been calculated, in which case it will be 0.

<dt>u_int32_t qs_cur_recno*<dd>Next available record number.
</dl>
<p>The Db::stat method either returns a non-zero error value or throws an exception that
encapsulates a non-zero error value on failure, and returns 0 on success.
<h1>Errors</h1>
<p>The Db::stat method may fail and throw an exception or return a non-zero error for errors specified for other Berkeley DB and C library or system methods.
If a catastrophic error has occurred, the Db::stat method may fail and
either return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a> or throw a
<a href="../api_cxx/runrec_class.html">DbRunRecoveryException</a>,
in which case all subsequent Berkeley DB calls will fail in the same way.
