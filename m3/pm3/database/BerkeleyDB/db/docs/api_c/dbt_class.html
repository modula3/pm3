<p>Storage and retrieval for the Berkeley DB access methods are based on key/data
pairs.  Both key and data items are represented by the DBT data
structure.  (The name <i>DBT</i> is a mnemonic for <i>data
base thang</i>, and was used because no one could think of a reasonable
name that wasn't already in use somewhere else.) Key and data byte
strings may refer to strings of zero length up to strings of
essentially unlimited length.  See <a href="../ref/am_misc/dbsizes.html">Database limits</a> for more information.
<p><blockquote><pre>typedef struct {
	void *data;
	u_int32_t size;
	u_int32_t ulen;
	u_int32_t dlen;
	u_int32_t doff;
	u_int32_t flags;
} DBT;</pre></blockquote>
<p>In order to ensure compatibility with future releases of Berkeley DB, all
fields of the DBT structure that are not explicitly set should be
initialized to nul bytes before the first time the structure is used.
Do this by declaring the structure external or static, or by calling
the C library routine <b>bzero</b>(3) or <b>memset</b>(3).
<p>By default, the <b>flags</b> structure element is expected to be set
to 0.  In this default case, when the application is providing Berkeley DB a
key or data item to store into the database, Berkeley DB expects the
<b>data</b> structure element to point to a byte string of <b>size</b>
bytes.  When returning a key/data item to the application, Berkeley DB will
store into the <b>data</b> structure element a pointer to a byte string
of <b>size</b> bytes, and the memory to which the pointer refers will be
allocated and managed by Berkeley DB.
<p>The elements of the DBT structure are defined as follows:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>void *<a name="data">data</a>;<dd>A pointer to a byte string.
<p><dt>u_int32_t <a name="size">size</a>;<dd>The length of <b>data</b>, in bytes.
<p><dt>u_int32_t <a name="ulen">ulen</a>;<dd>The size of the user's buffer (to which <b>data</b> refers), in bytes.
This location is not written by the Berkeley DB functions.
<p>Note that applications can determine the length of a record by setting
the <b>ulen</b> field to 0 and checking the return value in the
<b>size</b> field.  See the DB_DBT_USERMEM flag for more information.
<p><dt>u_int32_t <a name="dlen">dlen</a>;<dd>The length of the partial record being read or written by the application,
in bytes.  See the DB_DBT_PARTIAL flag for more information.
<p><dt>u_int32_t <a name="doff">doff</a>;<dd>The offset of the partial record being read or written by the application,
in bytes.  See the DB_DBT_PARTIAL flag for more information.
<p><dt>u_int32_t flags;<dd>
<p>The <b>flags</b> value must be set to 0 or by bitwise inclusively <b>OR</b>'ing together one or
more of the following values:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="DB_DBT_MALLOC">DB_DBT_MALLOC</a><dd>When this flag is set, Berkeley DB will allocate memory for the returned key
or data item (using <b>malloc</b>(3), or the user-specified malloc
function), and return a pointer to it in the <b>data</b> field of the
key or data DBT structure.  Because any allocated memory becomes the
responsibility of the calling application, the caller must determine
whether memory was allocated using the returned value of the
<b>data</b> field.
<p>It is an error to specify more than one of DB_DBT_MALLOC,
DB_DBT_REALLOC, and DB_DBT_USERMEM.
<p><dt><a name="DB_DBT_REALLOC">DB_DBT_REALLOC</a><dd>When this flag is set Berkeley DB will allocate memory for the returned key
or data item (using <b>realloc</b>(3), or the user-specified realloc
function), and return a pointer to it in the <b>data</b> field of the
key or data DBT structure.  Because any allocated memory becomes the
responsibility of the calling application, the caller must determine
whether memory was allocated using the returned value of the
<b>data</b> field.
<p>The difference between DB_DBT_MALLOC and DB_DBT_REALLOC
is that the latter will call <b>realloc</b>(3) instead of
<b>malloc</b>(3), so the allocated memory will be grown as necessary
instead of the application doing repeated free/malloc calls.
<p>It is an error to specify more than one of DB_DBT_MALLOC,
DB_DBT_REALLOC, and DB_DBT_USERMEM.
<p><dt><a name="DB_DBT_USERMEM">DB_DBT_USERMEM</a><dd>The <b>data</b> field of the key or data structure must refer to
memory that is at least <b>ulen</b> bytes in length.  If the length of
the requested item is less than or equal to that number of bytes, the
item is copied into the memory to which the <b>data</b> field refers.
Otherwise, the <b>size</b> field is set to the length needed for the
requested item, and the error ENOMEM is returned.
<p>It is an error to specify more than one of DB_DBT_MALLOC,
DB_DBT_REALLOC, and DB_DBT_USERMEM.
<p><dt><a name="DB_DBT_PARTIAL">DB_DBT_PARTIAL</a><dd>Do partial retrieval or storage of an item.  If the calling application
is doing a get, the <b>dlen</b> bytes starting <b>doff</b> bytes from
the beginning of the retrieved data record are returned as if they
comprised the entire record.  If any or all of the specified bytes do
not exist in the record, the get is successful, and any existing bytes
are returned.
<p>For example, if the data portion of a retrieved record was 100 bytes,
and a partial retrieval was done using a DBT having a <b>dlen</b>
field of 20 and a <b>doff</b> field of 85, the get call would succeed,
the <b>data</b> field would refer to the last 15 bytes of the record,
and the <b>size</b> field would be set to 15.
<p>If the calling application is doing a put, the <b>dlen</b> bytes
starting <b>doff</b> bytes from the beginning of the specified key's
data record are replaced by the data specified by the <b>data</b> and
<b>size</b> structure elements.  If <b>dlen</b> is smaller than
<b>size</b>, the record will grow; if <b>dlen</b> is larger than
<b>size</b>, the record will shrink.  If the specified bytes do not
exist, the record will be extended using nul bytes as necessary, and
the put call will succeed.
<p>It is an error to attempt a partial put using the <a href="../api_c/db_put.html">DB-&gt;put</a> function
in a database that supports duplicate records.
Partial puts in databases supporting duplicate records must be done
using a <a href="../api_c/dbc_put.html">DBcursor-&gt;c_put</a> function.
<p>It is an error to attempt a partial put with differing <b>dlen</b> and
<b>size</b> values in Queue or Recno databases with fixed-length records.
<p>For example, if the data portion of a retrieved record was 100 bytes,
and a partial put was done using a DBT having a <b>dlen</b> field of 20,
a <b>doff</b> field of 85, and a <b>size</b> field of 30, the resulting
record would be 115 bytes in length, where the last 30 bytes would be
those specified by the put call.
