<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The Dbc.put method stores key/data pairs into the database.
<p>The <b>flags</b> value must be set to one of the following values:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_AFTER">Db.DB_AFTER</a><dd>In the case of the Btree and Hash access methods, insert the data
element as a duplicate element of the key to which the cursor refers.
The new element appears immediately after the current cursor position.
It is an error to specify Db.DB_AFTER if the underlying Btree or
Hash database does not support duplicate data items.  The <b>key</b>
parameter is ignored.
<p>In the case of the Recno access method, it is an error to specify
Db.DB_AFTER if the underlying Recno database was not created with
the <a href="../api_java/db_set_flags.html#DB_RENUMBER">Db.DB_RENUMBER</a> flag.  If the <a href="../api_java/db_set_flags.html#DB_RENUMBER">Db.DB_RENUMBER</a> flag was
specified, a new key is created, all records after the inserted item
are automatically renumbered, and the key of the new record is returned
in the structure to which the <b>key</b> argument refers.  The initial
value of the <b>key</b> parameter is ignored.  See <a href="../api_java/db_open.html">Db.open</a>
for more information.
<p>The Db.DB_AFTER flag may not be specified to the Queue access method.
<p>If the current cursor record has already been deleted and the underlying
access method is Hash, Dbc.put will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">Db.DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
If the underlying access method is Btree or Recno, the operation will
succeed.
<p>If the cursor is not yet initialized or if a duplicate sort function
has been specified, the Dbc.put function will return EINVAL.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_BEFORE">Db.DB_BEFORE</a><dd>In the case of the Btree and Hash access methods, insert the data
element as a duplicate element of the key to which the cursor refers.
The new element appears immediately before the current cursor position.
It is an error to specify Db.DB_BEFORE if the underlying Btree or
Hash database does not support duplicate data items.  The <b>key</b>
parameter is ignored.
<p>In the case of the Recno access method, it is an error to specify
Db.DB_BEFORE if the underlying Recno database was not created with
the <a href="../api_java/db_set_flags.html#DB_RENUMBER">Db.DB_RENUMBER</a> flag.  If the <a href="../api_java/db_set_flags.html#DB_RENUMBER">Db.DB_RENUMBER</a> flag was
specified, a new key is created, the current record and all records
after it are automatically renumbered, and the key of the new record is
returned in the structure to which the <b>key</b> argument refers.
The initial value of the <b>key</b> parameter is ignored.  See
<a href="../api_java/db_open.html">Db.open</a> for more information.
<p>The Db.DB_BEFORE flag may not be specified to the Queue access method.
<p>If the current cursor record has already been deleted and the underlying
access method is Hash, Dbc.put will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">Db.DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
If the underlying access method is Btree or Recno, the operation will
succeed.
<p>If the cursor is not yet initialized or if a duplicate sort function
has been specified, Dbc.put will return EINVAL.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_CURRENT">Db.DB_CURRENT</a><dd>Overwrite the data of the key/data pair to which the cursor refers with
the specified data item.  The <b>key</b> parameter is ignored.
<p>If a duplicate sort function has been specified and the data item of the
referenced key/data pair does not compare equally to the <b>data</b>
parameter, Dbc.put will return EINVAL.
<p>If the current cursor record has already been deleted and the underlying
access method is Hash, Dbc.put will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">Db.DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
If the underlying access method is Btree, Queue, or Recno, the operation
will succeed.
<p>If the cursor is not yet initialized, Dbc.put will return EINVAL.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_KEYFIRST">Db.DB_KEYFIRST</a><dd>In the case of the Btree and Hash access methods, insert the specified
key/data pair into the database.
<p>If the underlying database supports duplicate data items, and if the
key already exists in the database and a duplicate sort function has
been specified, the inserted data item is added in its sorted location.
If the key already exists in the database and no duplicate sort function
has been specified, the inserted data item is added as the first of the
data items for that key.
<p>The Db.DB_KEYFIRST flag may not be specified to the Queue or Recno
access methods.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_KEYLAST">Db.DB_KEYLAST</a><dd>In the case of the Btree and Hash access methods, insert the specified
key/data pair into the database.
<p>If the underlying database supports duplicate data items, and if the
key already exists in the database and a duplicate sort function has
been specified, the inserted data item is added in its sorted location.
If the key already exists in the database, and no duplicate sort
function has been specified, the inserted data item is added as the last
of the data items for that key.
<p>The Db.DB_KEYLAST flag may not be specified to the Queue or Recno
access methods.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_NODUPDATA">Db.DB_NODUPDATA</a><dd>In the case of the Btree and Hash access methods, insert the specified
key/data pair into the database, unless it already exists in the database.
If the key/data pair already appears in the database, <a href="../api_java/dbc_put.html#DB_KEYEXIST">Db.DB_KEYEXIST</a>
is returned.  The Db.DB_NODUPDATA flag may only be specified if
the underlying database has been configured to support sorted duplicate
data items.
<p>The Db.DB_NODUPDATA flag may not be specified to the Queue or Recno
access methods.
</dl>
<p>
Otherwise, the Dbc.put method throws an exception that encapsulates a non-zero error value on
failure.
<p>If Dbc.put fails for any reason, the state of the cursor will be
unchanged.  If Dbc.put succeeds and an item is inserted into the
database, the cursor is always positioned to refer to the newly inserted
item.
<h1>Errors</h1>
<p>The Dbc.put method may fail and throw an exception encapsulating a non-zero error for the following conditions:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>EACCES<dd>An attempt was made to modify a read-only database.
</dl>
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
<p>The Db.DB_BEFORE or Db.DB_AFTER flags were specified, and the
underlying access method is Queue.
<p>An attempt was made to add a record to a fixed-length database that was too
large to fit.
<p>An attempt was made to add a record to a secondary index.
</dl>
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>EPERM  <dd>Write attempted on read-only cursor when the <a href="../api_java/env_open.html#DB_INIT_CDB">Db.DB_INIT_CDB</a> flag was
specified to <a href="../api_java/env_open.html">DbEnv.open</a>.
</dl>
<p>If the operation was selected to resolve a deadlock, the
Dbc.put method will fail and
throw a <a href="../api_java/deadlock_class.html">DbDeadlockException</a> exception.
<p>The Dbc.put method may fail and throw an exception for errors specified for other Berkeley DB and C library or system methods.
If a catastrophic error has occurred, the Dbc.put method may fail and
throw a <a href="../api_java/runrec_class.html">DbRunRecoveryException</a>,
in which case all subsequent Berkeley DB calls will fail in the same way.
