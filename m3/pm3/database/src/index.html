<P>Database and persistent storage related libraries and applications.

    <DD>GRAS is a set of libraries and programs that together implement
    a structure-oriented client/server database management system. In general,
    structure-oriented DBMS offer a richer set of data types and constructors
    than e.g. relational DBMS. The data model of GRAS is the directed,
    attributed, node and edge labelled graph. GRAS is not intended as a
    stand-alone system, but must be accessed via its application programming
    interface.
<DT><A REL=INCLUDE HREF="../persistence">Orthogonal Persistence</A>
    <DD>Libraries and <A REL=INCLUDE
    HREF="../persistence/libpm3common/src">interfaces</A> to orthogonally
    persistent distributed storage for Modula-3 objects. Persistent storage is
    (by default) provided by the GRAS3 transactional page server. An
    experimental binding to the SHORE object store is also available on
    machines where SHORE is installed. Example applications include
    implementations of the <A REL=INCLUDE HREF="../persistence/OO7">OO7</A>
    traversal operations and a <A REL=INCLUDE
    HREF="../persistence/primes/src">prime number generator</A> that starts 
    generating prime numbers where it left off in its previous invocation.
    Orthogonally persistent applications run as clients of the GRAS3 page
    server (or SHORE server), which must be running before they can
    execute. See the information on getting started with GRAS3 in the GRAS3 <A
    REL = INCLUDE HREF="../GRAS3/README">README</A>.
<DT><A REL=INCLUDE HREF="../stableobjects/src">Stable Objects</A>
    <DD>With this package, user objects may easily be converted to 
    crash-resistant persistent objects.
<DT><A REL=INCLUDE HREF="../smalldb/src">Small Database</A>
    <DD>Precursor to the stable objects, SmallDB is seldom used for new
    development.
