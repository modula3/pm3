(Weich)

This directory contains the tests for the stable object package

The current version does not test the stub generator. The stable object
StableTest.T was generated manually.

To run the test do the following:

* first compile in this directory (by calling m3build)
* edit shell script "maketest"; set the variables in the first few lines according
  to your site
* run "maketest"

The outcome is a number of calles of the test program. All tests should 
return "passed"!
