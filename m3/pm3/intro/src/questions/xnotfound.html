<H1>X libraries not found?</H1>
<P>
The position of X libraries is stored, for instance for
pre-compiled PM3 LINUXELF binaries, in the template file 
m3config/src/LINUXELF as well as in X11/LINUXELF/.M3EXPORTS
(m3build/templates/LINUXELF, and X11R4/LINUXELF/.M3EXPORTS for
SRC-M3).
Thus you may want to edit these files if your X libraries are
located in an uncommon place.
<P>
