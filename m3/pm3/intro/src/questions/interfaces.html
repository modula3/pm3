<H1>Why objects and interfaces?</H1>

<P>
Allan Heydon on <tt>comp.lang.modula3</tt>,  May 4th 1993:

<P>
Modula-3 provides two separate mechanisms for data-hiding: one for 
hiding details about how interfaces are implemented, and the other 
for hiding details about how objects are implemented.

<P>
The first data-hiding mechanism is realized by the distinction between 
interfaces and modules. Clients can only import interfaces, so the 
names declared in the modules implementing those interfaces are hidden 
from clients. Note that this mechanism has only two levels; a name 
is either declared in an interface, or it isn't. If a name is only 
declared in a module, it can't be used by a client. 

<P>
The second data-hiding mechanism is realized by opaque types and 
revelations. A Modula-3 interface may declare an object type to be 
opaque, in which case only a subset of the fields and methods of 
that object are revealed to clients importing the interface. Furthermore, 
the Modula-3 revelation mechanism allows a designer to reveal successively 
more fields and methods of an object in a series of interfaces. The 
fields and methods visible to a client then depends on which interfaces 
the client imports. 

<P>
The latter mechanism is quite flexible. As opposed to the interface/module 
data-hiding mechanism, opaque types allow you to define an arbitrary 
number of levels at which more and more information about the implementation 
of your object is revealed. 

<P>
See Sections 2.2.10, 2.4.6, and 2.4.7 of "Systems Programming with 
Modula-3" for more information about opaque types and about partial 
and complete revelations.
