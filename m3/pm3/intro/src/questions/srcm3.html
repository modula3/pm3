<H1>What is SRC Modula-3?</H1>

<P>
<A HREF="file://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Modula-3/">SRC-Modula-3 </A>
was built by the DEC Systems Research Center and is freely available and
redistributable, with source code.
In Europe it is also available from
ftp-i3.informatik.rwth-aachen.de in pub/Modula-3.
The most recent version is release 3.6
<P>
The DEC SRC Modula-3 contains the following:
<P>
<UL><LI>  A native code compiler: uses the GCC backend; on machines/operating
systems that have self-describing stacks, an optimized exception
handling mechanism is provided, on other architectures,
setjmp/longjmp is used. A very fast integrated backend is available
on some platforms (currently NT386 and Linux i386).
<P>
The compilation system provides for minimal recompilation. 
Only those units that depend on the modified interface item
will be recompiled.
<LI>  m3build: tool that performs dependency analysis and
builds the Modula-3 programs and libraries.
<LI>  m3gdb: a Modula-3 aware version of GDB.
<LI> Several tools for performance and coverage analysis.
<LI>  A large standard library (libm3)  providing
<P>
<UL><LI>  A multithread, incremental, generational, conservative garbage
collector
<LI>  Text manipulation.
<LI>  Generic Containers: Lists, Sequences, Tables, SortedLists, SortedTables
<LI>  Atoms and Symbolic expressions (Lisp like lists)
<LI>  An extensible stream IO system
<LI>  Typesafe binary object transcription (persistent objects)
<LI>  Operating system interfaces
<LI>  Portable interfaces to the language runtime
</UL>
<P>
All standard libraries are thread-friendly. 
Modula-3 can readily link with existing C libraries; many libraries 
including X11R4 and various UNIX libraries are available as 
part of libm3. 
<LI>  Several other libraries for designing graphical user interfaces
and distributed applications.
