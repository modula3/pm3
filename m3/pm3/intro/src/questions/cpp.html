<P>
There is no problem to call C++ functions declared as
extern C. You must use a C++ aware linker (e.g. the C++ compiler).
A complete example of M3 calling C++ objects, which in turn call
M3 callbacks, is available in 
<A HREF="../../../text/sgmltools/sgml/src/nsgmls">the sgml library</A>.
<P>
On some platforms, a call to get the static variables constructors called may
be required:

You must use your C++ compiler as the linker, rather than /bin/cc
or /bin/ld.

You need to call the function '_main'. The easiest way to do this
is to have the following set of interfaces and implementations:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
        INTERFACE CXXMain;
          &lt;*EXTERN &quot;_main&quot;*&gt; CxxMain;
        END CXXMain;

        MODULE CXXMain;
        BEGIN
          CxxMain();
        END;</TT></PRE>
<P>
and then import CXXMain into your M3 main module. This will
ensure that the C++ function _main gets called.
