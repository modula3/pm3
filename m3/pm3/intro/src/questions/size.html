<P>
Modula-3 programs are larger than C programs for the following reasons:
<P>
<OL><LI>   The fixed runtime is substantially larger.  It contains a
garbage collector, a thread runtime, and exception support.
Note that Hello World is virtually all runtime.  For
larger programs the runtime is not an issue.
<LI>   The generated code includes runtime checks for out-of-bound
array references and NIL pointer.  Many of these checks could
be removed by a more sophisticated compiler.
