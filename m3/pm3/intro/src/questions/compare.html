The paper evaluates Oberon, Modula-3, Sather, and Self in the 
context of object-oriented programming.  While each of these 
programming languages provide support for classes with inheritance, 
dynamic dispatch, code reuse, and information hiding, they do so in 
very different ways and with varying levels of efficiency and simplicity.
A single application was coded in each language and the experience
gained forms the foundation on which the subjective critique is based.
