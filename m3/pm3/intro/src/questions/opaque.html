These two keywords are necessary because of two quite different
features of the language. REVEAL is necessary because Modula-3 has
opaque types and partial revelations. BRANDED is necessary because the
Modula-3 type system uses structural equivalence instead of name
equivalence.
<P>
In Modula-3, the concrete structure of a type can be hidden from
clients in an interface. A common idiom is:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
  INTERFACE I;

  TYPE
    T &lt;: TPublic;
    TPublic = OBJECT
      (* fields *)
    METHODS
      (* methods *)
    END;

  END I.</TT></PRE>
<P>
The line &quot;T &lt;: TPublic&quot; introduces the type &quot;I.T&quot; as an opaque subtype
of the type &quot;I.TPublic&quot;. It does not reveal any of the other details
of the concrete structure of &quot;I.T&quot; to clients. Hence, &quot;I.T&quot; is said to
be an <i>opaque type</i>. Put another way, the structure of &quot;I.T&quot; is
only partially revealed to clients.
<P>
In addition, it is possible to reveal more of &quot;I.T&quot;'s structure in
other interfaces, like this:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
  INTERFACE IRep;

  IMPORT I;

  TYPE
    TPrivate = I.TPublic OBJECT
      (* more fields *)
    METHODS
      (* more methods *)
    END;

  REVEAL
    I.T &lt;: TPrivate;

  END IRep.</TT></PRE>
<P>
This interface declares a type &quot;IRep.TPrivate&quot; that is a subtype of
&quot;I.TPublic&quot;. It also asserts that &quot;I.T&quot; is also a subtype of
&quot;IRep.TPrivate&quot;. A client that imports only the interface &quot;I&quot; has
access only to the fields and methods in &quot;I.TPublic&quot; when accessing an
object of type &quot;I.T&quot;, but a client that imports both &quot;I&quot; and &quot;IRep&quot;
also has access to the fields and methods in &quot;IRep.TPrivate&quot; when
accessing an object of type &quot;I.T&quot;.
<P>
The &quot;REVEAL&quot; statement in this module simply asserts a subtype
relation. Unlike type declarations, revelations introduce no new
names. Hence, we could not have used the &quot;TYPE&quot; keyword in this case
because the type &quot;I.T&quot; has already been declared once (albeit
opaquely) in interface &quot;I&quot;.
<P>
Every opaque type must have a complete revelation. A complete
revelation has the form:
<P>
<PRE><TT>
  REVEAL
    T = TConcrete;</TT></PRE>
<P>
The revelation specifies that &quot;TConcrete&quot; is the concrete type for the
opaque type &quot;T&quot;.
<P>
The Modula-3 type system uses structural equivalence instead of name
equivalence. This means that two types are equal iff they have the
same structure. One consequence of this rule is that two types you
might intend to be distinct may actually be equal. This can have
unintended effects on the run-time behavior of your program. For
example, if both types that you expect to be distinct are actually
structurally equivalent and the two types guard two arms of a TYPECASE
statement, the arm for the second type will never be taken.
<P>
If you want to avoid accidental equalities between two types, you can
brand one (or both) of them with the BRANDED keyword. A branded type
is equivalent to no other type, even if it is structurally equivalent
to some other type. In essence, the BRANDED keyword adds a bit of
virtual structure to the type that guarantees it will be distinct from
every other type.
<P>
The Modula-3 syntax allows you to supply a text constant as a name for
the brand. If you don't supply an explicit brand, the compiler will
make one up; however, the implicit brand invented by the compiler is
not guaranteed to be chosen deterministically. Hence, explicit brands
are useful if you are communicating types from one process to another
and if you want to be sure that the branded type written by one
process matches the branded type read in by the other.
<P>
Any two opaque types in a program must be distinct. Otherwise, it
would be too easy for clients to accidentally trip over type
collisions like the TYPECASE example mentioned above. To enforce the
restriction that all opaque types are distinct, the language requires
that the type &quot;TConcrete&quot; in the complete revelation above must be a
branded type.
