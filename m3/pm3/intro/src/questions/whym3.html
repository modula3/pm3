Here is what John Polstra, author of the popular CVSup, replied:

&gt; Erhm, why on earth did you chose Modula3 ?? I newer got the warm
&gt; fuzzies by mr. Wirth's languages
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Modula-3 came out of DEC's Systems Research Center, and as far as I
know, Wirth had nothing to do with it.

<PRE><TT>
&gt; they are maybe good educational tools, but for real world apps,
&gt; nah.... :)
</TT></PRE>

<P>I've used the original Wirth Pascal and Algol-W, and that's certainly
true of both of them.  I've never used Wirth's Modula, so I can't
comment on it.

<P>Modula-3 really is a different language, designed specifically for
systems programming by some extremely competent and experienced
people who knew what they were doing.

<PRE><TT>
&gt; Oh and yes I have seen apps written in modula3, all of which was
&gt; horrible performers, and impossible to port to new platforms, so
&gt; the management decide a complete rewrite in, guess what, C!
</TT></PRE>

<P>Are you sure it was Modula-3 and not something else with "Modula"
in the name?  The SRC Modula-3 compiler supports about 25 different
platforms.

<P>Plenty of real world apps (*big* ones) have been written in Modula-3,
and they perform pretty well.  There's also the SPIN OS project
<A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/">[SPIN]</A>
at University of Washington, in which the kernel was written in
Modula-3.  It performs well, too.


<P>Now, you can always argue that a program would be somewhat faster
and somewhat smaller if it had been written in C.  Hey, guess what?
I was around when Unix V6 came out, and the same stuff was written
about it.  Just substitute "C" for "Modula-3" and "assembly language"
for "C".  The answer is the same in both cases:  Unix would not
exist as we know it today if it had been written in assembly
language.  CVSup would not exist as we know it today if it had been
written in C (or C++, for that matter).

<P>OK, so why on earth did I choose Modula-3?  In no particular order:

<OL>
<LI>I needed application level threads, and threads are an integral
part of the Modula-3 language.  About the only reasonable alternative
was to use pthreads with C or C++.  But pthreads was not well
supported under FreeBSD at that time.

<LI>I needed a graphical display during development so that I could
monitor the 3 client threads as they were running, debug them,
appraise their relative performance, and find the bottlenecks.
Modula-3 has a very nice toolkit for creating GUIs quickly and
painlessly.  (OK, so the scrollbars are as ugly as sin.)

<LI>Modula-3 is a compiled language that is reasonably efficient.

<LI>I needed to use some low level system functions, e.g., mapping
files into memory.  Modula-3 provides good access to such functions,
and it is quite easy to add interfaces to foreign libraries such
as "libz".

<LI>Modula-3 has good support for networking.

<LI>It is a mature and stable language that has been used in a number
of serious, large projects.  The language and compiler have been
stable for about 5 years, which is more than you can say for C++.

<LI>It has nice support for object oriented programming, including a good
type system, a nice exception model, and a modern high-performance
garbage collector.  These traits, IMHO, contribute powerfully to
producing well-structured, maintainable programs.

<P>Now before you label me an unstudly OO weenie, please consider
this.  I've been programming in C professionally for 19 years.  I
made my living for many years writing C compilers and related tools
such as assemblers, linkers, and disassemblers.  I still use C and
C++ when I feel they are appropriate for a project, not to mention
when I have to because that's what the client wants to use.  I have
experience programming in many many different languages.  Different
languages are good for different things.  I still like programming
in C (and C++ for some things), but I'm glad I didn't use it for
CVSup.

<LI>I had just come off a huge 3+ year C++ project.  During that time, I
learned just how much C++ sucks.  I did not feel like doing it again
right away "for fun."

<LI>I have spent my entire professional career getting paid to use the
wrong tools, because, e.g., the manager read that C++ was "popular."
For once, just once, on a _hobby_ project, I decided I was going to use
the tool I felt was the best for the job at hand.  I thought about it
long and hard, evaluated several options (C and C++ among them), and
eventually chose Modula-3.  I have never regretted that decision.
</OL>

<P>Any questions? :-)
