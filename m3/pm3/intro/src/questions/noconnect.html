<H1>Why are exceptions raised by X or Network Objects applications?</H1>
<P>
Graphical applications (based on Trestle/X Windows) raise the
TrestleComm.Failure exception when the DISPLAY environment variable is
incorrect or the X server is refusing the connection. They raise
MachineIDPosix.Failure if the network configuration files are
incorrectly set up, especially on LINUX; /etc/hosts must contain at
least a loopback address (127.0.0.1) and the /etc/rc scripts an
appropriate ifconfig command (/etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1; /etc/route
add 127.0.0.1).  Applications with Network Objects may also raise
exceptions or consume all the CPU time available when the network
configuration files are incorrect.
