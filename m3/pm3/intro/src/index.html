<H1>PM3: The Modula-3 distribution of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal</H1>

<DIV CLASS=ABSTRACT>
<P>This free distribution integrates the excellent SRC Modula-3 development
environment with a number of local enhancements as well as numerous
outside contributions. Key features include an SGML/HTML based documentation
system, easier bootstrap and build, improved Linux support (faster compiler 
and better debugging support), and NT 386 support through the gnu win32 
version of gcc.
</DIV>

<P>This distribution was assembled at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal to
satisfy internal teaching and research needs as well as to serve
academic and industrial externel needs, along the lines of cooperation on
which the internet was built. This free and rapidly evolving Modula-3
distribution is directly based on the excellent DEC SRC Modula-3 development
environment. It contains several enhancements produced by Modula-3 programmers
from around the world.

<P>Each package group, package or file has information about its authors 
and copyright. Documentation files were often contributed separately
by different authors and possibly under a different copyright. Thus,
the author mentioned in the documentation may or may not have contributed to
the code in the corresponding package. Similarly, the copyright mentioned
in the documentation applies to the documentation alone. The source files
may come under a different copyright.

<P>The current PM3 release was developed under the responsibility 
of Michel Dagenais (michel.dagenais@polymtl.ca),
Antony Hosking (hosking@cs.purdue.edu, for Solaris), 
and Louis-Dominique Dubeau (ldd@step.polymtl.ca).
More groups and individuals are expected
to join this effort and take responsability for various parts of the
package hierarchy.

<P>Since April 2002, development and maintenance efforts at the 
Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal have ceased, and the central PM3 repository
has moved to www.elegosoft.com. Everybody interested in working on the
PM3 code or the integration of PM3 features into the more actively
developed CM3 code base is welcome to join the small Modula-3 community
and request CVS write access permissions for the source code repositories
from elego Software Solutions. See <a href="http://www.elegosoft.com/m3.php3">
http://www.elegosoft.com/m3.php3</a> for details.
