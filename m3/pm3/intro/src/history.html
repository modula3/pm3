<H1>History</H1>

<P>
The Modula-3 distribution of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal is directly
based on SRC Modula-3 release 3.6, which appeared in early 1996.

<H2>SRC Modula-3</H2>
<P>
Version 1.0 was the first public release of SRC Modula-3. It contained the
compiler, runtime and a few tools. The compiler generated intermediate C code
and was only tested on VAX Ultrix 3.1. Subsequent 1.x releases were ported
to several platforms and the libraries reorganized.

<P>
Version 2.0 implements the twelve language changes proposed after the initial
trial period. The compiler and code generator were rearranged and improved.
With subsequent 2.x releases, several new platforms were supported and
significant new packages appeared (FormsVBT, Zeus...).

<P>
Version 3.0 is the first public release of the gcc based native code
generator m3cc, Modula-3 aware debugger m3gdb, and smart recompilation
system m3build. The standard library was cleaned up after a close
review by the interface police. A Windows NT port appeared as well as
new significant packages such as Network objects and Obliq.
Subsequent 3.x releases brought bug fixes, more platforms supported,
speed tuning, and several new packages such as Stable Objects and Anim3D.

<H2>PM3</H2>
<P>
With release 3.6, in early 1996, DEC SRC Modula-3 reached a mature state.
Bill Kalsow, responsible for the compiler, left DEC SRC around that time
and later joined Critical Mass, a commercial Modula-3 vendor. Since then,
a number of advanced Modula-3 projects at DEC SRC continued in areas such 
as 3D animation, static verification, constraint based geometrical editor, 
and distributed
applications. In many other areas, including the compiler and base libraries,
few updates were made at DEC SRC. Moreover, these updates are available 
separately from the release and must be integrated manually.

<P>
At the same time, several contributions appeared from Modula-3 programmers
around the world and included several bug fixes, enhancements, and
new libraries or tools such as a more platform independent version
of Pickle, an integrated code generator for Linux ELF,
a simplified single process version of m3build-m3-quake,
a port of SRC Modula-3 to NT386 using gnu-win32, and several new
packages such as CVSsup, M3COCO, and M3 TXL.

<P>
After consultations with several key academic Modula-3 programmers with 
similar needs, including Peter Klein, Blair McIntyre, and Richard Watts,
it was decided to create a new distribution based on SRC Modula-3.
The new distribution is under CVS version control and is
accessible to remote maintainers.

<P>
The first public release of PM3 included SRC release 3.6 with all patches 
applied, a fast integrated Linux ELF code generator, a simplified
m3build-m3-quake with accordingly simplified templates for platform
customization, m3cc and m3gdb based on newer versions of gcc and gdb,
full platform support for NT386GNU through gnu-win32,
a simplified bootstrap and build process, a directory hierarchy
to organize the 130+ packages, SGML/HTML based documentation,
and an automated release procedure to produce updated sources, bootstraps
and binaries every week.
