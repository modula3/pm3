<H2>Supported platforms</H2>
<P>
PM3 has been ported to several platforms. Bootstraps for the following 
platforms are currently produced regularly.

<DL>
<DT>DS3100<DD>DECstation 5000/200 Ultrix 4.2.
<DT>FreeBSD2<DD>IBM PC, FreeBSD 2.0.
<DT>HPPA<DD>HP 700/800, HP-UX 8.0.
<DT>IRIX5<DD>SGI/MIPS, IRIX 5.2.
<DT>LINUXELF<DD>IBM PC, Linux (ELF object file format)
<DT>NT386GNU<DD>IBM PC, Windows/NT and Windows 95 using gnu-win32 tools.
<DT>SOLgnu<DD>Sparcstation, Solaris-2.x w/ unbundled gcc.
<DT>SPARC<DD>Sparcstation-1, SunOS 4.1.x.
</DL>

The following platforms are still active but bootstraps could not be
built lately, mostly because of problems in the gcc based backend.

<DL>
<DT>ALPHA_OSF<DD>Alpha/AXP, OSF/1.
<DT>IBMR2<DD>IBM RS/6000, AIX 3.1.
<DT>NEXT<DD>NeXT(M68K).
<DT>NT386<DD>IBM PC, Windows/NT and Windows 95.
</DL>

The following platforms have not been active lately.

<DL>
<DT>AP3000<DD>Apollo DN4500, Domain/OS 10.2
<DT>ARM<DD>Acorn R260, RISC iX 1.21.
<DT>FreeBSD<DD>IBM PC, FreeBSD 1.1.5
<DT>HP300<DD>HP 9000/300, HP-UX 7.0
<DT>IBMRT<DD>IBM RT, IBM/4.3 (AOS 4.3).
<DT>LINUX<DD>IBM PC, Linux.
<DT>OKI<DD>Okidata 7300 (i860) AT&amp;T SVR4.0.

<DT>VAX<DD>VAX 8800, Ultrix 4.2.

<H2>Porting to new platforms</H2>

<P>
In order to port PM3 to a new platform, the following steps are required.
The differences in PM3 between different POSIX platforms are relatively small
and a new port may often be achieved in a matter of a few days or less. 
New entries in tables, and new directories, 
are obtained by copying the corresponding portions from
an existing similar platform and making a few modifications.
It is assumed that the new platform already fits in 32 or 64 bits,
and POSIX or WIN32; if not, additional work will be required.

<UL>
<LI>Install PM3 on a supported platform.
<LI>Select a short unique name for the new platform.
<LI>Add an entry for the platform in table <I>Platforms</I>
    of the template file <TT>m3config/src/COMMON</TT>. Add a platform
    specific template in directory <TT>m3config/src</TT>.
<LI>In file <TT>language/modula3/m3compiler/m3middle/src/Target.m3</TT>,
    add an entry in table <I>Systems</I>, and a section describing the
    new platform in the <TT>CASE sys OF</TT> statement in the <I>Init</I>
    procedure.
<LI>In directory <TT>libs/m3core/src/C</TT>, add a platform specific
    subdirectory defining the interface to C functions such as
    <TT>setjmp</TT>, <TT>longjmp</TT>, <TT>_setjmp</TT>, <TT>_longjmp</TT>,
    to <TT>stdio.h</TT>, and to <TT>string.h</TT>.  Be careful to
    get the size of the <TT>jmp_buf</TT> right.

<LI>In directory <TT>libs/m3core/src/Csupport</TT>, add a platform specific
    subdirectory containing a properly configured <TT>dtoa.c</TT>.

<LI>In file <TT>libs/m3core/src/float/m3makefile</TT> add an entry for the
    new platform in table <I>_FloatPieces</I>.

<LI>In file <TT>libs/m3core/src/runtime/m3makefile</TT> add an entry for the
    new platform in table <I>EXCEPTION_IMPL</I>. Add a platform
    specific subdirectory in <TT>libs/m3core/src/runtime</TT> implementing
    the creation and manipulation of stacks for threads, and defining
    and installing signal handlers for signals such as SIGVTALRM and
    SIGSEGV.

<LI>In file <TT>libs/m3core/src/time/POSIX/m3makefile</TT> add an entry for the
    new platform in table <I>_DateImpls</I>.

<LI>In file <TT>libs/m3core/src/unix/m3makefile</TT> add an entry for the
    new platform in table <I>_UnixPieces</I>. If needed, add a platform
    specific subdirectory in <TT>libs/m3core/src/unix</TT> defining the
    interface to system services.

<LI>In file <TT>libs/libm3/src/random/m3makefile</TT> add an entry for the
    new platform in table <I>_RandomPieces</I>.

<LI>In package <TT>language/modula3/m3compiler/m3bootstrap</TT> issue the
    command <TT>m3build -DBOOTTARGET=XXX</TT>, where XXX should be replaced
    by the new platform. If all goes well, a bootstrap should be produced
    in the subdirectory <TT>YYY/pm3-XXX</TT> where YYY is the platform
    from which the port is initiated. This bootstrap may then be used
    as described in the installation instructions.
